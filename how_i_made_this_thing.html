    <h2 id="step-1">Step 1: Writing Everything in Markdown</h2>
    <p>There is something about writing in Markdown that is so simple and effortless (no doubt that's by design). The goal of this format that can be used, as the main <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown page</a> makes clear, "to format virtually any document," seems to be tailor-made for academics, especially those of who don't often work with images or figures or graphs or plots. The goal of our work is the text, the text itself, not the flashy figures or supporting graphs, just the text, so a format where one can focus as much as possible on the actual content of the document seems to be an absolute necessity. Of course, it's a wonderful benefit that something as simple as Markdown can be easily converted (<a href=https://pandoc.org>pandoc</a> is the conversion tool of choice, of course) to pretty much any other format or file type you want is an added benefit as well.</p>
    <p>As some might know, it can be difficult to take things originally written in Microsoft Word and other programs and easily get those texts to live on the web—Markdown makes it a breeze. Wanting to hyperlink something in a Word document can itself be time-consuming: selecting the text where the hyperlink will appear, CTRL+K (or ⌘K for those on Macs), pasting the link, etc. Markdown makes it so easy, just wrap the text in [] and then follow it with a parenthesis that contains the actual hyperlink: [Here's a link](link address goes here). Very simple. Of course, for those academics that love the footnote, that's easy too: just stick the footnote in brackets with a caret: [^1] and then, anywhere else in the same document, adding "[^1]: Here's the text of your footnote," will get exactly what one wants. Again, very simple—and very easy once one gets the hang of it.</p>
