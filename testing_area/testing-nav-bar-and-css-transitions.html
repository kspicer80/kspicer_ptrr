<h2 id="introductory-matters-1">0.1 Versions of this Document</h2>
<p>For those that would would prefer to engage this work in a form(at) that isn't in HTML, I have provided a .pdf version <a href="ptrr.pdf">here</a>. I consider the HTML version here to be the “preferred” way to read this reflection largely because I have been greatly influenced, more and more as of late, by the work of Jonathan Reeve, who argues in his nice little blog post, <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2021/05/stop-making-pdfs/">“The Case Against PDFs”</a>, that we academics should really “stop pretending that we’re all using paper.” Of course, one of the things about the PDF format that I am sure most writers love is its ability (“a feature and not a bug,” lovers of this file type will quickly say!) to imitate the printed form. But, as Reeve seems so right to note, to my mind, we do so little these days on paper. As Reeve puts it:
<blockquote>
  <p>At least, speaking for myself and my academic work, email is much more common than paper mail, ebooks are rapidly growing in popularity, and journals are mostly accessed electronically. The global pandemic has driven us even further in digitization. More and more, we sign contracts, pay our electrical bills, and even get our drivers’ licenses renewed, electronically, over the Internet. So then why do we insist on using electronic file formats that mimic the constraints of physical paper, which we no longer use?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>My sense is that one could double-down on this quite strongly: if someone is composing something they want other people to read (or, sheesh, simply just be “easy to find” in some way), then one of the worst places to put that something (one of the worst “forms” in which to have it live) is in a .pdf. There’s little doubt—as we all know—that probably everything in the world today lives in some HTML format. I will spare my readers the incredibly long list of affordances that HTML offers over that of the PDF. I will just say here that for those that still love this old format that strives so mightily to simulate the printed page, it's available to them: the linked .pdf copy above was converted from the document originally written in HTML (well, I should say, written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> first, then converted to .html, tweaked with the <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">“Tufte CSS”</a>—created by <a href="https://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and based on the groundbreaking work of Edward Tufte<label for="sn-1a" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1a" class="margin-toggle"/><span id="1a" class="sidenote">Here of course we mean his fantastic book, <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, 2nd Ed. (Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 2001).</span>—and then, ultimately, outputted to .pdf). There are some spots later in this reflection—readers will be able to see them when they come to them—where I do some interactive graph plotting that will not be available in the static .pdf format—the HTML version, however, does have that interactivity available to readers who would like to stay here on this page. Of course, good rhetoric teaches us rhetoricians to be aware of far more than one way to persuade an audience—in other words, we should give readers all kinds of options and choices for how they would like to engage our work. I would like to think I tried to do just that here in providing this alternate version of my Reflection.</p>

<h2 id="introductory-matters-2">0.2 Initial Caveats</h2>
<p>I am well-aware that the guidelines for the “Post-Tenure Review”
process in the <em>Policy Manual</em> explicitly note (2.9.5) that this
document should present “a reflective narrative on the progress toward
achieving the goals set at the last review and updated goals for the
next five years of practice including how they fulfill the University’s
defined mission.”<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="1" class="sidenote"><em>USF Policy Manual</em>, p. 144.</span> That
section continues on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reflective narrative should include: <br />
1. A personal evaluation of performance quality and effectiveness in areas of teaching, scholarship,
and service since the previous developmental review. <br />
2. A description of professional development efforts and activities undertaken, particularly
if such efforts have been in response to feedback from prior evaluations
or related to recently revised professional goals. <br />
3. A description of professional goals and plans for continued professional development in
the areas of teaching, scholarship, and service for the ensuing five
years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me, I would like to
rather not slavishly follow these guidelines; instead, I would like to
spin them in my own direction, to my own purposes—hoping, of course,
that the “spirit” of these guidelines are addressed, even if it is often
the case that the “letter of the policy” is, perhaps, all-too-thoroughly
missed. My plan here is to, largely, select out only a chunk of the last
five years of my time here at USF as an Associate Professor. I hope that
the major story (or stor<em>ies</em>) I tell here will make it glaringly
clear precisely why I have decided to select out this much shorter time
frame; it is also my intention to make very legible why the major thing
that happened within this frame cinched together all the different
arenas of my work at USF: teaching, scholarship, and service have all
been threaded and interwoven together because I was fortunate in the
Fall of 2020 to meet someone exceedingly special, a student by the name
of MaKenzie Hope Munson. Actually, I was lucky to meet two incredibly
exceptional students, but MaKenzie is the one I will spotlight so
extensively and heavily here. In addition to her story, I will attempt
to narrate a good deal (although far from all) of the work done with my
other absolutely brilliant (and also one-of-a-kind) student, William D.
Mastin, whom I encountered shortly after meeting MaKenzie; I will try to
address the impacts he has made on me and on all three aspects of my job
as well.</p>
<p>Although I feel perfectly justified—again, the argument for this will
follow below—in this selection process, I will attempt, in some of the
later sections, to speak to some of the larger contexts outside of
MaKenzie and William; it’s true—I have had so many more students than
just these two over the last five years, but in my mind they are
exorbitantly special to me and both are mind-bogglingly unique and
singular and each are so in their own absolutely singular and unique
ways. It is hard to put into words how profoundly they have managed to
change things for me. We all know a little (I think) something about how
human desire and enjoyment work: is it possible for one to eat a dinner
that is so good one doesn’t ever want to eat anything else ever again?
Many will say, “No, of course not, that’s just silly nonsense,” and
others will say, “Well, why would you even want to close off your desire
in that way? What if there’s another better meal down the road you never
anticipated?” A similar question could be posed about our most favorite
students: “Can one have a student so special, so significant, so
impactful, that they don’t ever want any more students?” On its face,
one should say “No”—but the past two years have really got me wondering
about whether or not such answers are sufficient for those students who
are so insanely transformative for us that hyperbole is the only real
way to do them justice. How else is one to try to make clear how
infinitely proud we are to be able to call these students “our
students”; how else is one to try to make explicit and obvious how much
more proud we are to be able to say we were “the teacher” of these two
students?</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to cross paths with my one mentor in graduate
school. He loved to say—when we would reminisce about the time when we
encountered one another and one another’s thinking—that it was “love at
first sight.” From the very first time we met, there was an
instantaneous rapport—we instantly both felt as if we had known each
other in a previous lifetime or had always somehow always already met
one another countless times over in the past. He was always hopeful that
such a thing would not be a one-off for me—that I too would some day
meet a student with whom this same “instant rapport” and “love at first
sight” would be perfectly on display for all to see; countless times
after I graduated, when we would meet to talk of Heidegger, Lacan, and
Derrida, and all our old “kindred spirit philosophers,” we renewed and
relived this immediate rapport with one another. I will never forget the
day when I told him that I finally really understood all of the things
he said he felt upon meeting me for the first time: joy that was hard to
express, a feeling of genuine intellectual camaraderie that had never
really happened before with another else, and so much more. I told him
her name was MaKenzie and that she struck me as being my exact
intellectual double or twin—he said there wasn’t anything more I needed
to say: he understood it all so well without me needing to say much
else. The smile on his face at my good luck: I’ll never, ever forget
it.</p>
<p>I am aware that this “review” is supposed to be a review <em>of me
and my work</em>—but such a thing is far from easy and it’s next to
impossible to do it without talking about MaKenzie. I will speak of my
work, but the use of that word “my” needs to be opened-up to include so
much more than just me. First and foremost it needs to be opened-up so
as to include MaKenzie. Trying to muster as much humility as I possibly
can—which, I think, although I could be grossly wrong, is my typical
<em>modus operandi</em>—I should say that I would like to say that I
have actually achieved quite a bit since my being granted tenure back in
2018. I chaired the English and Foreign Languages Department for four
years; I worked on creating from the ground up the Digital Humanities
major (along with the wonderful work and shared energy from my
departmental colleague, Dr. Anna Ioanes); I helped spearhead and build
an entire slate of graduate-level courses for the REAL Academy for high
school teachers wishing to become credentialed as Dual-Credit English
teachers; I have published scholarly, peer-reviewed essays, along with a
nice short review on a contemporary poet (prior to this contemporary
poetry would not have been in my somewhat long list of wheelhouses);
much more is in the <a href="ptrr_materials/1_supporting_materials/a_cv/kas_cv_updated_january_24_2023.pdf">CV now</a> in comparison with the version presented
for
tenure.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="2" class="sidenote">That version is still available via my online
portfolio for tenure <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6-K6sp-D2hZ0YDX4u2vn5p267UU9QcMlujQUrBGbxA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</span>
One could say that I have legitimately achieved a good deal over the
past few years, but none of it (absolutely <em>none</em> of it) compares
at all to MaKenzie and all the work that she and I have done
together—and I feel exceedingly confident that there will never come a
day when that is no longer true.</p>
<p>Thus, without further ado, I would like to try to starting diving
into all of the wonderful work she and I have done together over the
past two years.</p>
