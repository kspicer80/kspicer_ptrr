<p>For those that would prefer to read this document in a .pdf version, they can head over <a href="ptrr.pdf">here</a>. In that version I have some brief comments in this section about why one might want to prefer the .html version here rather than the .pdf.</p>
<h2 id="introductory-matters-2">0.2 Initial Caveats</h2>
<p>I am well-aware that the guidelines for the “Post-Tenure Review”
process in the <em>Policy Manual</em> explicitly note (2.9.5) that this
document should present “a reflective narrative on the progress toward
achieving the goals set at the last review and updated goals for the
next five years of practice including how they fulfill the University’s
defined
mission.”<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="1" class="sidenote"><em>USF Policy Manual</em>, p. 144.</span> That
section continues on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reflective narrative should include:<br />
1. A personal evaluation of performance quality and effectiveness in
areas of teaching, scholarship, and service since the previous
developmental review.<br />
2. A description of professional development efforts and activities
undertaken, particularly if such efforts have been in response to
feedback from prior evaluations or related to recently revised
professional goals.<br />
3. A description of professional goals and plans for continued
professional development in the areas of teaching, scholarship, and
service for the ensuing five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me, I would like to
rather not slavishly follow these guidelines; instead, I would like to
spin them in my own direction, to my own purposes—hoping, of course,
that the “spirit” of these guidelines are addressed, even if it is often
the case that the “letter of the policy” is, perhaps, all-too-thoroughly
missed. My plan here is to, largely, select out only a chunk of the last
five years of my time here at USF as an Associate Professor. I hope that
the major story (or stor<em>ies</em>) I tell here will make it glaringly
clear precisely why I have decided to select out this much shorter time
frame; it is also my intention to make very legible why the major thing
that happened within this frame cinched together all the different
arenas of my work at USF: teaching, scholarship, and service have all
been threaded and interwoven together because I was fortunate in the
Fall of 2020 to meet someone exceedingly special, a student by the name
of MaKenzie Hope Munson. (Actually, I was lucky to meet two incredibly
exceptional students, but MaKenzie is the one I will spotlight so
extensively and heavily here. In addition to her story, I will attempt
to narrate a good deal (although far from all) of the work done with my
other absolutely brilliant (and also one-of-a-kind) student, William D.
Mastin, whom I encountered shortly after meeting MaKenzie; I will try to
address the impacts he has made on me and on all three aspects of my job
as well.)</p>
<p>Although I feel perfectly justified—again, the argument for this will
follow below—in this selection process, I will attempt, in some of the
later sections, to speak to some of the larger contexts outside of
MaKenzie and William; it’s true—I have had so many more students than
just these two over the last five years, but in my mind they are
exorbitantly special to me and both are mind-bogglingly unique and
singular and each are so in their own absolutely singular and unique
ways. It is hard to put into words how profoundly they have managed to
change things for me. We all know a little (I think) something about how
human desire and enjoyment work: is it possible for one to eat a dinner
that is so good one doesn’t ever want to eat anything else ever again?
Many will say, “No, of course not, that’s just silly nonsense” and
others will say, “Well, why would you even want to close off your desire
in that way? What if there’s another better meal down the road you never
anticipated?” A similar question could be posed about our most favorite
students: “Can one have a student so special, so significant, so
impactful, that they don’t ever want any more students?” On its face,
one should say “No”—but the past two years have really got me wondering
about whether or not such answers are sufficient for those students who
are so insanely transformative for us that hyperbole is the only real
way to do them justice. How else is one to try to make clear how
infinitely proud we are to be able to call these students “our
students”; how else is one to try to make explicit and obvious how much
more proud we are to be able to say we were “the teacher” of these two
students?</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to cross paths with my one mentor in graduate
school. He loved to say—when we would reminisce about the time when we
encountered one another and one another’s thinking—that it was “love at
first sight.” From the very first time we met, there was an
instantaneous rapport—we instantly both felt as if we had known each
other in a previous lifetime or had always somehow always already met
one another countless times over in the past. He was always hopeful that
such a thing would not be a one-off for me—that I too would some day
meet a student with whom this same “instant rapport” and “love at first
sight” would be perfectly on display for all to see; countless times
after I graduated, when we would meet to talk of Heidegger, Lacan, and
Derrida, and all our old “kindred spirit philosophers,” we renewed and
relived this immediate rapport with one another. I will never forget the
day when I told him that I finally really understood all of the things
he said he felt upon meeting me for the first time: joy that was hard to
express, a feeling of genuine intellectual camaraderie that had never
really happened before with another else, and so much more. I told him
her name was MaKenzie and that she struck me as being my exact
intellectual double or twin—he said there wasn’t anything more I needed
to say: he understood it all so well without me needing to say much
else. The smile on his face at my good luck: I’ll never, ever forget
it.</p>
<p>I am aware that this “review” is supposed to be a review <em>of me
and my work</em>—but such a thing is far from easy and it’s next to
impossible to do it without talking about MaKenzie. I will speak of my
work, but the use of that word “my” needs to be opened-up to include so
much more than just me. First and foremost it needs to be opened-up so
as to include MaKenzie. Trying to muster as much humility as I possibly
can—which, I think, although I could be grossly wrong, is my typical
<em>modus operandi</em>—I should say that I would like to say that I
have actually achieved quite a bit since my being granted tenure back in
2018. I chaired the English and Foreign Languages Department for four
years; I worked on creating from the ground up the Digital Humanities
major (along with the wonderful work and shared energy from my
departmental colleague, Dr. Anna Ioanes); I helped spearhead and build
an entire slate of graduate-level courses for the REAL Academy for high
school teachers wishing to become credentialed as Dual-Credit English
teachers; I have published scholarly, peer-reviewed essays, along with a
nice short review on a contemporary poet (prior to this contemporary
poetry would not have been in my somewhat long list of wheelhouses);
much more is now in the CV now in comparison with the version presented
for
tenure.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="2" class="sidenote">That version is still available via my online

One could say that I have legitimately achieved a good deal over the
past few years, but none of it (absolutely <em>none</em> of it) compares
at all to MaKenzie and all the work that she and I have done
together—and I feel exceedingly confident that there will never come a
day when that is no longer true.</p>
<p>Thus, without further ado, I would like to try to starting diving
into all of the wonderful work she and I have done together over the
past two years.</p>

Working with My Greatest and Most Favorite Student in My Entire Career
as a Teacher/Scholar: <br /> MaKenzie Hope Munson (’23)</h2>
<p>It is quite hard to know exactly know where to begin the stories
about ourselves that are so central to the people we are now. Most will
say it’s a perfectly good bet to just “start at the beginning.” Back in
the Fall of 2020, I received an e-mail from Dr. Elizabeth McDermott
(English faculty member at the time and now current interim Dean of CAS)
that the “Freshmen Orientation Day” that semester found her meeting a
student who was hoping to become an English major. I e-mailed her back
very quickly, telling her I already thought I knew who this was, one
MaKenzie Hope Munson. In between that visit day and Dr. McDermott’s
e-mail, MaKenzie herself had already e-mailed me—saying something that
makes her crinkle her face just a little bit each and every time I razz
her with it—saying that she wished to introduce herself and “make
[herself] known,” as she put it in that
e-mail.<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="3" class="sidenote">MaKenzie Munson, personal communication, October
26, 2022.</span> I kid her about this incessantly now, but I don’t think
there was any better way she could have introduced herself—even an
e-mail with even a smidgen less boldness than this very first one is
something I cannot ever even imagine her doing, ever. I should say, too,
that I had a very clear picture of the kind of student I was dealing
with here in this first e-mail exchange. Even before we ever crossed
paths, she was on my radar—and this was simply because of the structures
our department has working to help us—over each summer semester—place
students into College Writing sections. MaKenzie came to college, came
my way, with an incredibly impressive number of college credits already
under her belt from a combination of Dual- and AP credit earned in high
school. Students that come to college with that many credits almost
never, never, never, never, never come around—and I myself had never,
ever seen anything quite like it. Given that, it was clear to me long
before we ever encountered each other that she was no doubt on the
lookout for someone to push her, to push her thinking, her growth, her
knowledge, her writing, everything. MaKenzie, even from the very first
moment we ever met, possessed an intellectual intensity and fierceness
that is exceedingly rare—again, I’ve never, ever seen it before in any
other student I’ve had the privilege to teach over my eighteen-year
teaching career and especially not in someone so young. What she had
achieved before even coming to college was exceedingly rare for an
eighteen-year old.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned to Dean McDermott and a few others, our meeting
was a really big-E “Event” for
me.<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="4" class="sidenote">Here I am relying very strongly on Alain
Badiou’s conception of big-E “Events” in his most well-known
philosophical text, <em>Being and Event</em>, trans. Oliver Feltham (New
York: Continuum, 2007). For a slightly more “layperson’s” treatment of
this text and this key idea of Badiou’s, the <em>Why Theory</em> <a
href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/event/id1299863834?i=1000581320963">podcast
episode</a> by Todd McGowan and Ryan Engley devoted to this work is not
at all a bad start.</span> Meeting MaKenzie did really thoroughly cut my
academic and professional life (and, to be frank, just “my life” in
general) into a time that was “<em>before</em> MaKenzie” and then
another altogether different time (and altogether different me, too, I
should confess) that was “<em>after</em> MaKenzie.” I really do not
think it took any time at all for the two of us to instantly trust one
another in a very, very, very deep way—she says that she was extremely
excited that I became her advisor (she’s taken to preferring the
“mentor” term now as she feels this moniker does not have any kind of
“expiration date” of sorts in the way that words like “advisor” or
“teacher” so often do) and took her under my wing, so to speak. MaKenzie
crossed my path as an absolute one-of-kind—and she needed someone to see
that the trajectory that would be best for her was perhaps not one that
could be easily found in any course catalog or curriculum list. As a way
to fulfill part of the “Senior Capstone” requirement for the English,
MaKenzie composed a lengthy reflective essay (“Reflection on My Time as
an Undergraduate at the University of St. Francis”) that narrated her
experiences with me as an undergraduate. I will be citing this text
constantly—and my very first recourse to it comes here now. In that
essay, she wrote very poignantly about what it was she wanted from her
undergraduate education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My time at the University of St. Francis began in a way that one
might think is similar to most other college students; with being part
of the graduating class of 2020 and all the lackluster experiences that
Covid allowed, I was excited to dive into all of this headfirst. What I
realized quickly was that the boredom I had felt in too many high school
classes was not just a symptom of going to a public high school, but
more an indication that I wanted something different than most
educational institutions are willing to
offer.”<label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="5" class="sidenote">MaKenzie Munson, “Reflection,” p. 1.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew from the start—even from “before the start”—how special she
was and never missed a moment to prioritize her and her learning and her
work in the hopes that I could actually manage to give her the challenge
that I felt she was so deeply craving. MaKenzie herself notes when
things started to really ratchet up for us—and that was in the Fall of
2021:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That next semester, I took my first English course and while I fell
in love with that program, my overall desire to be at USF faded. Over
the span of 2021, I had thoughts of transferring, thoughts of leaving,
thoughts of taking a break from school; USF was taking more from me than
I could scrounge up in all my classes, jobs, and experiences. At the end
of 2021, I was desperate and confided to Dr. Spicer my feelings,
thinking that I had already lost all capacity for loving learning and
reading. In true Spicer fashion, though, he listened and devoted himself
to helping me in any way possible; thus arose the possibility of my
graduating early. He told me that I could be done by this time next
year, that it wouldn’t be easy, but that we would do it together. This
togetherness was unfamiliar to me in an academic setting, as I had
always been taught and encouraged to work alone. I would like to say
that I was wary for a brief moment about this proposition, but that
would be untruthful; I was super excited to jump into my last year with
the support of someone I had grown to admire and look up to so much at
USF.<label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="6" class="sidenote">Ibid.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I say, I’ve never really had such rapport solidify as quickly as
it did between MaKenzie and me—my relationship with my own mentor is the
only other parallel. This motif of “togetherness” that she mentions here
is of the deepest importance—all of the work that we did we did together
in a way that is what I think true pedagogy should be at the end of the
day. So what did we do, exactly?</p>
<p>From the very first time we conversed, I spoke to her of wanting her
to be strong, autonomous, confident in herself and her abilities and
capacities, and never afraid to tackle everything with a passionate
intensity that can often be off-putting (especially when that intensity
is found within people of the female gender). Over the course of three
semesters her education gave her a crash course (equivalent, in so many
ways, I would say, to what students would get at the graduate school
level) in Continental Philosophy broadly construed—from Immanuel Kant
and G. W. F. Hegel to Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault to Eve
Kosofsky Sedgwick and Judith Butler—and even a good deal of work by
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. There was a huge focus put on the
work of Friedrich Nietzsche and a great deal of the psychoanalytic
tradition, with a sizable quantity of emphasis placed on the primary
source materials of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. The combination of
Nietzsche’s conceptualizations of language (especially with regards to
his treatment of figurative language within philosophy and conceptual
thinking in general) with the theoretical advancements put forward by
Freud and the larger psychoanalytic school on the nature of the
unconscious, language, and desire within the “speaking being” of the
human, all quite literally rekindled the embers of her love of learning,
reading, and thinking. These thinkers—through the almost daily
conversations we held together in my office—opened up a brand new world
and an incredibly rich new terrain for her to roam in and through. In
this last Fall 2022 semester as an undergraduate, she and I completed a
full slate of courses together (all of which we designed solely in
response to her own desire and drive to learn more about certain topics
and texts), doing an incredibly deep dive into the <em>Hebrew Bible</em>
and the works of Homer and Vergil, a course on 20th and 21st Century
theories of gender and sexuality, and an entire directed study devoted
to the reading of First Amendment Supreme Court cases.</p>
<p>How did we come upon such a unique and singular curriculum here for
MaKenzie? The pedagogical principle was very simple—and the inspiration
came to us (or, rather, the substantiation/justification came after we
were already engaging in this eclectic study) from something that many
would like to locate in the work of—surprise, surprise—Freud. In a
chapter from Adam Phillips’s <em>The Beast in the Nursery: On Curiosity
and Other Appetites</em>, entitled “The Interested Party,” the
well-known psychoanalytic essayist focuses on Freud’s early work on the
“sexual researches of children.” This chapter very cogently puts forth a
very key psychoanalytic idea, namely, that our interests and curiosities
can so easily be squashed and killed by the so-called “ideals of
education,” as Freud puts it (this is something that MaKenzie herself
was very presciently aware of in her own educational history even before
coming my way, as her remarks quoted above make very bright and clear).
There is one spot in particular where Phillips talks about how we all
have certain “official” and “unofficial” interests. The former are the
ones that we get given to us by our “culture” or our “schooling system”
while, in contrast, the “unofficial” interests are the ones that we
pursue ourselves without caring at all that these obsessions might be
seen as sub-optimal (or, even worse, purely otiose) from the (admittedly
paltry) perspective of all the “official” ones that all of our systems
think one <em>should</em> have. Putting things very bluntly—par for
Phillips’s course, I should note—:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why read Henry James rather than watch pornography—both, of course,
sublimations? This is clearly a moral question about the roots and the
consequences of our most impassioned interests. And interests, as Freud
shows, are never innocent but always morally ambiguous. What Freudian
descriptions of a life formulate in a specific way are the senses in
which we have official and unofficial interests, and that we are often
unaware of the difference (when I’m reading Henry James, I may be
reading pornography). As a crude Freudian—a not uninteresting thing to
try to be these days—one could say that patients are suffering from not
having made good enough sublimations. That they have got further and
further away from those things that—for whatever reason—matter most to
them. That their official interests—what Freud called “civilized
morality”—the “ideals of education”—are spellbinding, their unofficial
interests hidden. Their official education has extinguished their
unofficial education. It is not always enlivening to be well
informed.<label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="7" class="sidenote">Adam Phillips, <em>The Beast in the Nursery: On
Curiosity <br />and Other Appetites</em> (New York: Vintage Books,
1998).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pedagogical goal, for me, was always to keep MaKenzie’s
fundamental “unofficial interests” in mind: she came one day saying she
wanted to actually read the Jewish texts of the Torah (okay, awesome, I
said to her, let’s <em>read the texts together</em> and not settle for
mere commentaries or paraphrases of them); she came on another day
wanting to know what psychoanalysis thought about the differences
between masculinity and femininity vis-à-vis their respective
relationships to language (fantastic, let’s read some Freud and Lacan to
hammer that out); she wanted to know what some of the really rigorous
and powerful critiques of Freud and psychoanalysis were—being very
unhappy with the standard pop culture treatments of this tradition that
she had gotten spoon-fed to her by previous teachers (excellent, let’s
read the <em>very best</em> critiques of Freudian psychoanalysis:
e.g. Deleuze and Guattari’s <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>); she often spoke of
wanting to read more theory devoted to feminism and theories of gender
and sexuality (splendid, let’s read a ton of the biggies in that
field—Michel Foucault
especially<label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="9" class="sidenote">Early on together we had a read—again,
together—of his infamously canonical <em>The History of Sexuality,
Volume 1: An Introduction</em>, trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Random
House, 1980). This text became a kind of lightning rod for MaKenzie’s
intellectual work and growth as Foucault’s rather poor treatment of
psychoanalysis became a constant refrain and leitmotiv for us. As is
usual for good intellectual work, though, this text oriented all kinds
of connections between these other areas of interest for MaKenzie:
language, gender and sexuality, and so much more. We toyed with the idea
of reading the other two volumes of this work by Foucault (which many, I
think, never manage to slog their way through), but it didn’t quite
align with our larger goals, so we tabled them for a later
date.</span>—and use them to, perhaps, ultimately, return to a text that
she and I read and reread together one summer and absolutely adored,
Margaret Atwood’s <em>The Handmaid’s
Tale</em><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="8" class="sidenote">Margaret Atwood, <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>
(New York: Anchor Books, 1986).</span>); she has <em>always</em> wanted
to go to law school as her main vocation/career goal (wonderful, let’s
read as many <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">SCOTUS cases</a> as
we possibly can); and the list goes on and on and on of things MaKenzie
“just wanted to learn more about” and that I designed reading lists to
try to feed that voracious appetite of hers.</p>
<p>I should just confess here that one need not simply take my word for
how well this went—MaKenzie herself can—and did—speak to this much more
strongly and properly than I ever could. Concerning how much she learned
by taking this rather unorthodox, “unofficial,” “sped-up/slightly
compressed” educational plan, she has written: “While some may think of
this unconventional graduation and course track as somehow less full, I
have experienced the exact opposite; these past two semesters have
fulfilled me more than the total sum of my education before 2022. I hope
that I have properly conveyed that throughout the bulk of this
reflection.”<label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="10" class="sidenote">This is, once again, from her reflection,
p. 8.</span> MaKenzie’s intellect is an incredibly tough nut to
crack—her standards for intellectual engagement and rigor are incredibly
high—and this is thus extremely high praise; she was already a
frighteningly hungry thinker and reader coming out of high school. To
say, as she does here, that the time spent studying with me gave her
“<em>more than</em> the total sum of [her] education before 2022” (my
emphasis) is an enormously big thing for her to say—given her standards,
this is probably downright shocking—and not at all to be taken lightly.
Again, trying to say this with as much humility as I can, I think I know
exactly what she means and I wouldn’t even think of claiming it wasn’t
absolutely true.</p>
<p>MaKenzie possesses this incredibly beautiful quality of never being
willing to have anything slow her down—and there is much more that I
would like to say about this key facet of her overall personality and
intellectual predisposition. Often when I think about MaKenzie and how
her mind works, metaphors having to do with speed and quickness always
come first to mind. Difficult or complex arguments that it would take
other students a great deal of time to parse and think through are
understood and grasped by her with the velocity of a lightning flash. I
literally could not count the number of times we read a dense text
together by Deleuze or Foucault or Lacan—or an incredibly complicated or
perhaps even abstruse Supreme Court opinion—and her mind would
immediately grab hold of all the major knots, contentions, and problems
within the texture of the argument. I’ve never, ever seen anything quite
like it in a student before.  Her intellectual agility and maturity are
truly from another planet. All too often her mind would just simply cut
directly to the heart of the matter of a problem or issue at hand for
that particular day. Most other students need time to work through
difficult texts and arguments and ideas in order to find the real true
core. MaKenzie never, ever seemed to need all that much time. Her
analytical rigor is unmatched—unmatched not only in its cogency and
persuasiveness, but also in terms of an unbelievable degree of quickness
and speed. It is quite frankly a joy to be able to say I saw it in
action every single day we sat and read and thought and learned and
wrote together over the past two years.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to flesh out and further substantiate all of
this would be to point to the rather extensive notes she and I kept as a
log of all of our work over the Fall 2022 semester, where—as already
mentioned—we did a number of independent study courses together. The
length of that document suggests I spare the committee members that full
treatment (it came in, upon my last check, to roughly one-hundred and
seventy-pages single-spaced, covering all of the courses we did that
semester). However, out of a plethora of examples one could easily
mention from that document, I would like to extract, as illustrative
examples, just a few moments and texts and readings and conversations
that not only display perfectly MaKenzie’s acumen and perspicacity as a
thinker and reader—all of which I got to literally see grow stronger and
stronger each and every day we spent conversing together in the
office—but also to give my readers some sense of her increased
intellectual intensity over time, which seemed to multiply almost
exponentially each and every time we spoke. I also want these examples
to serve as exemplary of her capacities to handle an incredibly diverse
and wide range of different kinds of work—and I would love to try to
pull out a story from each of the five courses we did together in her
last semester here at USF.</p>
<h3 id="engl335-ancient-literature">1.1.1 ENGL335: Ancient
Literature</h3>
<p>My first test case here came from one of her independent studies
devoted to “Ancient Literature,” where we read together some really key,
canonical texts from the Western literary tradition—one of the most
significant being a couple of texts from the Torah. It’s necessary for
me to keep in readers’ minds that in between every session we had
together in this past Fall semester, MaKenzie managed to grow in her
incisiveness each and every day. This is something that I have never,
ever encountered in any other student I’ve ever had. Hopefully this
example will make clear the truth of such a sentiment. I also hope to
try to show some of the various threads that we are able to weave with
the other courses we were doing here in this same semester.</p>
<p>One day while making our way through Genesis, MaKenzie fixated and
focused in on a curious little thing in Chapter 24 of that had to do
with the intriguing way in which the servant of Abraham interacts with
the woman who will become Isaac’s wife, Rebecca. In the Charles Kahane
translation from 1963—wonderfully provided by Sefaria <a

for us, especially as it includes seemingly every tiny piece of Jewish

original Hebrew is there side by side with hyperlinked lexicon entries
for each original Hebrew word—as I say, an absolute gold mine is this
website.)</span>—we get the following exchange between “the senior
servant” (24:2) and Rebecca:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After giving her the gifts, he said: “Whose daughter are you? Tell me
please, is there room for us in your father’s house, where we may lodge?
She answered each question in the proper order:”I am the daughter of
Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” And she continued:
“We have ample quantity of both straw and fodder, as well as room for
lodging. (24:23-25)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MaKenzie was terribly intrigued by this mention of Rebecca’s
“answer[ing] each question in the proper order.” Why is this here and
what is it doing, she asked. Before diving in any further, I just want
to make clear how fantastic it is that she managed to zero-in on this in
the first place. One can see how genuinely impressive this is when one
goes to consult Rashi’s own
commentary,<label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="14" class="sidenote">Again, his full commentaries are available on
Sefaria <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/topics/rashi?tab=sources">here</a>.</span>
which is an absolute <em>sine qua non</em> within this tradition of
Jewish Biblical commentary. <a
href="(https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Tanakh/Rishonim%20on%20Tanakh/Rashi)">Rashi’s
interpretation</a> does actually mention this thing that MaKenzie
noticed all on her own and without any prompting—as far as I can
recall—from me. <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.24.23.2?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en">Rashi
parses</a> this key verse thusly: “DAUGHTER OF BETHUEL — She answered
his first question and his last last.” One can easily see here that what
looks like “commentary” or “interpretation” simply repeats the original
text. Why does Rashi himself bother to redouble this little detail here
with his “commentary”? After letting her know how impressed I was that
she instantly latched on to something that Rashi himself mentions too,
MaKenzie was endlessly fascinated by all of this still: what is the
detail doing in the story and what is Rashi’s redoubling of it doing?
How is it working? How is it functioning? Indeed—fantastic questions,
and even more fantastic as she is still so early on in her academic
career and growth. (This kind of “natural talent”—I’m not quite sure
what else to call it—is an absolute staple of MaKenzie’s intellectual
structure. She possesses a profound natural aptitude for something that
it usually takes other students a great deal of graduate-level work to
actually be able to do and perform. She is preternaturally gifted in
this arena, thus necessitating our taking a path for her academic
journey that didn’t at all resemble similar paths for other students not
quite like her—which, to be honest, is every single other student I have
ever taught.)</p>
<p>I gave a response, at the time, that I was somewhat happy with, but
now I’m not so sure. I do think that there is a significance to the
ordering of the questions and responses—MaKenzie’s intuition here is
still spot-on—because the servant is trying to “track the prophecy,” as
I put it on that day. Abraham has already told his servant how he will
know who is to be the wife of his son, Isaac. My sense is that the text
is not satisfied with simply saying that the servant will know they have
found the right woman because she manages to do all of the things that
Abraham said she would—i.e. Abraham says Isaac’s future wife will offer
the jar of water to the servant and then will proceed to offer, again,
water to his camels. Indeed, this is exactly what happens in the Genesis
text, but Rashi’s sly little (redoubling) comment makes one wonder if
this is sufficient. Is it also necessary that these actions be carried
out <em>in the proper order</em>? My sense is “Yes,” and that this
ordering is what Rashi’s comment is really up to at the end of the day.
Still, my point here seems easy enough to state simply: what kinds of
students—again, young students, students yet to turn twenty—ask
questions like this? As I say, I’ve never ever had anybody do it before
MaKenzie and I’ve no doubt known beginning graduate students who would
miss all this. There’s no hyperbole here: it’s very impressive.
Furthermore, she was able to link this up with yet another spot in the
text where she saw this same issue of order and ordering popping up.</p>
<p>The second time this ordering concern (within Rashi’s own text) shows
up is with one of Isaac’s sons, Jacob—the context here again concerns
marriage (which, once more, MaKenzie was the first to highlight),
specifically the relationship between Jacob and Rachel—whom he has been
pursuing while working for her father for many years. Jacob has left one
night with his wife and children and Laban catches up to him, asking him
<a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.30?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en">a
series of questions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Laban said to Jacob, “What did you mean by keeping me in the dark
and carrying off my daughters like captives of the sword?<br />
Why did you flee in secrecy and mislead me and not tell me? I would have
sent you off with festive music, with timbrel and lyre.<br />
You did not even let me kiss my sons and daughters good-by! It was a
foolish thing for you to do.<br />
I have it in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father’s
[house] said to me last night, ‘Beware of attempting anything with
Jacob, good or bad.’<br />
Very well, you had to leave because you were longing for your father’s
house; but why did you steal my gods?” (31:26-30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the very next verse we are told of Jacob’s response: “Jacob
answered Laban, saying ’I was afraid because I thought you would take
your daughters from me by force. But anyone with whom you find your gods
shall not remain alive! In the presence of our kin, point out what I
have of yours and take it” (31:31-32). Once again, Rashi <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.31?ven=Torah*Yesharah,*translated*and*edited*by*Chas.*Kahane.*New*York,*1963&amp;lang=en&amp;with=Rashi&amp;lang2=en">notes</a>
the ordering relation in a somewhat opaque way (as is par for the course
for him): “BECAUSE I FEARED — He answered his first question first, for
he has asked him (<em>Genesis</em> 31:26)”[what has thou done …] that
thou has carried away my daughters, etc.” (this being the first of all
Laban’s questions).” Once more—we get just a couple cryptic lines from
Rashi where we see him highlighting of the ordering of the answers, but
Rashi does not flesh out this ordering or what it’s doing or its
function, etc. which—broken record here, to be sure—shows the
perspicacity of MaKenzie’s initial question about this spotlighting of
the “ordering of answers” issue.</p>
<p>At the time, after extracting out this key matter, we spoke together
of all kinds of different ways one could parse this topic of answering
questions in the proper (i.e. “original”?) order: it could easily be
done out of courtesy, out of a proper sense of conversational decorum;
MaKenzie even wondered if one could just call it “good common sense” to
answer questions in the order in which they’re posed. I still haven’t
managed to carve out enough time to canvas and dig through all the
commentary on this passage—who has?!—nor have I had the opportunity to
dive deep into the Midrash treatments about these passages—but I do find
it absolutely wonderful (and told MaKenzie the next time we met that
week) that the one who gets described as following this pattern is
Jacob, the beloved son of … who? Well, Rebecca, obviously—who, as we
know from the parts of the story chronicling the adventures of those
twin boys (Jacob and Esau, prefers him over all others (Esau in
particular, of course).</p>
<p>This excavation work was seemingly always only preliminary to
something much more significant—and that was the way in which MaKenzie
and I fell immediately into a pattern where we would use a particular
text (along with the extracted kernel of an idea that came through her
so often brilliant close and intense reading of that text/kernel) only
as a jumping off point for us. Day after day after day each week, the
assigned reading served as impetus for what someone might consider to be
“tangential concerns”: these tangents were also spots where we “leapt
away from a text,” following what Deleuze and Guattari love to call a
“line of
flight”<label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle"/><span

Tamsin Lorraine in <em>The Deleuze Dictionary</em>, ed. Adrian Paar
(Edinburgh: Edinburgh UP, 2005) pp. 144-46.</span> in another direction
entirely. The line of flight we followed and pursued from the “ordering”
concern had a great deal to do with some of the uncanny (uncanny? not
sure that’s the best word here, but it’s the one that keeps coming
foremost to mind) resonances between parents and children throughout
these stories in the Tanakh. If the text weaves together all of these
subtle, subterranean, ways in which the two twin boys—Jacob and
Esau—mirror their parents, we wanted to try to track something that
would be quite characteristic not of Jacob but of Esau.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avivahzornberg.com/">Avivah Gottlieb
Zornberg</a> really fantastically highlights a very deep and dark
sentiment that shows up in the character of Esau, which she herself
links back to the <em>Akedah</em> that Isaac himself suffered as a
child.<label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="16" class="sidenote">See her masterful book, <em>The Murmuring Deep:
Reflections on the Biblical Unconscious</em> (New York: Schocken Books,

incredibly melancholic streak to him, a streak that she says makes sense
given the fact that he is Isaac’s favorite (in contrast, of course, to
his twin brother, Jacob, who, as already noted, is his mother’s
favorite). This difference seems to manage to greatly orient and
constellate these storylines: When Jacob asks Esau to sell him his
birthright (in <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.33?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&amp;lang=bi&amp;aliyot=0"><em>Genesis</em>
25:33</a>), Esau responds: “I am at the point of death, so of what use
is my birthright to me?” It may be my own personal melancholic streak,
but I so vibe with this response, I can’t even begin to say how much.
This is the response of one who has so deeply intuited and understood
his
<em>being-toward-death</em>.<label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle"/><span

href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.32?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&amp;lang=bi&amp;with=Rashi&amp;lang2=en">Rashi’s
commentary</a> is intriguing, but was not quite à propos for our
purposes in this context). “I could be dead tomorrow,” Esau seems to
say, of what use is a birthright to someone who knows right down deep in
their bones that she is always on the verge and doorstep of death?
Indeed, what a fantastic question. Is there a better one for one to
pose? Zornberg argues that Esau has somehow come to some awareness
(either directly or indirectly, it seems to matter very little) of his
own father’s brush with death as a young child. Is this sentiment simply
to be linked to the life of the hunter; the life of the one who risks
life and limb every day in the hunt; is this not the sentiment and deep
feeling of the one who (unlike Jacob, who, we are also told, spends so
much of his time at home, in his parents’ “tents”) risks everything?
Certainly, no doubt! But is this explanation sufficient? I am not
sure—personally, both MaKenzie and I did really prefer to slide toward
Zornberg’s reading, who says that some of the <em>Akedah</em> experience
has obviously rubbed off on the favorite son of Isaac. I dig it. “… of
what use is my birthright to me? Of what use to me is the future?” Every
mortal being poses this question. I greatly enjoy how the text does not
at all shy away from such a trial and experience. The first son is so
like the father; the second son is favored by, and is so similar to, the
mother. And the text refuses to do anything but affirm these disunities;
I cannot speak more highly of such texts and such refusals.
Additionally, I cannot even speak more highly of the fact that all of
this was generated by MaKenzie and I together—all “leaping off and away
from,” to some degree, the text in question for that day/week.</p>
<h3 id="engl372-shakespearea-tiny-aside">1.1.2 ENGL372: Shakespeare—A
Tiny Aside</h3>
<p>As one last example coming off of the previous section—and it’s
possible this here doesn’t really need its own section heading—, I would
like to speak briefly about how all of this got marshaled to talk about
a work we read for an entirely different course—viz. the course devoted
to Shakespeare. This same week we had the story of Jacob, et. al., on
the docket, we also read (again, really nice synchronicity here!)
<em>The Merchant of Venice</em>. As all good readers of that play know,
the infamous trials of Jacob as shepherd for Laban’s flock plays an
incredibly significant role in that story—and Shakespeare masterfully
masterfully mobilize this storyline in <a
href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/the-merchant-of-venice/"><em>Merchant
of Venice</em></a> to talk about the role of wealth, money, capital, and
so much more, plays in this story of Shylock. Shylock’s reading of the
entire Jacob story is endlessly fascinating and intriguing—and MaKenzie
also found this to be true for her as well—as Shylock zeroes-in on
Jacob’s amassing of wealth vis-à-vis Laban as a perfect analogue for his
role as moneylender and financier. It thus makes sense that he would
gravitate to one of the twins over the other. There is something really
significant about Esau’s lack of interest (pun intended here, for sure)
in stockpiling (of what use is stockpiling for one who does not at all
take the next day as a given?), in amassing and accumulating for the
future,
etc.<label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="18" class="sidenote">This is not, of course, the only allusion or
resonance one could highlight between these different texts. All good
Shakespeare readers know how the bard will link this lack of a future to
the question of homosexual desire <em>re</em> Antonio’s melancholy
(which, again, as everyone knows, literally opens the play: “In sooth, I
know not why I am so sad: / It wearies me; you say it wearies you; / But
how I caught it, found it, or came by it, / What stuff ’tis made of,
whereof it is born, / I am to learn / And such a want-wit sadness makes
of me / That I have much ado to know myself” [I, i, 1-7]. Indeed, all
throughout the play Shakespeare will continually fashion the
homosocial/-sexual connections between Antonio and his dear “bosom
lover” [III, iv, 17], as Portia puts it, i.e. Bassanio). There is thus a
similar emotional valence, a similar emotional tonality and resonance,
an uncannily similar affect, between the melancholy of Antonio and that
of Esau, the one who has intuited the profound terror, horror, and
despair that was the <em>Akedah</em>. Jacob is the one who
stockpiles—the one who banks on the future; Esau is the one who says
that all we really have is now—tomorrow is mere fancy. (Of course, for
those potential readers who work in the same field as I do will
immediately draw fruitful parallels with the incredibly pathbreaking
work on the intimate link between queerness and the future laid out most
clearly and strongly by Lee Edelman in his <em>No Future: Queer Theory
and the Death Drive</em> (Durham, NC: Duke University P,
2004).</span>—that struck both of us as so
interesting.<label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="19" class="sidenote">I’m not quite sure how else to fit this in, so
this footnote also seems as good a place as any—but the next week after
this when we covered Joseph’s story, MaKenzie was incredibly excited to
tell me that she was not all surprised to see that Joseph—another
character (or perhaps <em>the</em> character) who <em>really</em> knows
how to stockpile for the future (it is this idea that he utilizes in
order to save Pharaoh and Egypt and himself from the impending famine
indicated by Pharaoh’s infamous prophetic dream of the lean and fat
calves)—is … guess who’s favorite? Yes, you’re right: Joseph is Jacob’s
favorite.</span></p>
<p>I would like to now rehearse the <em>Merchant</em>/Jacob conjunction.
How did MaKenzie and I try to read this conjoining? We started with the
key exchanges between Shylock and Antonio in I.iii.67-93—apologies to my
readers here in advance for the overly long quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ANTONIO<br />
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow<br />
By taking nor by giving of excess,<br />
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br />
I’ll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet possessed<br />
How much you would?<br />
SHYLOCK  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.<br />
ANTONIO  And for three months.<br />
SHYLOCK<br />
I had forgot–three months. [To Bassanio.]<br />
You told me so.–<br />
Well then, your bond. And let me see–but hear<br />
you:<br />
Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow<br />
Upon advantage.<br />
ANTONIO  I do never use it.<br />
SHYLOCK<br />
When Jacob grazed his Uncle Laban’s sheep–<br />
This Jacob from our holy Abram was<br />
(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)<br />
The third possessor; ay, he was the third–<br />
ANTONIO<br />
And what of him? Did he take interest?<br />
SHYLOCK<br />
No, not take interest, not, as you would say,<br />
Directly “interest.” Mark what Jacob did.<br />
When Laban and himself were compromised<br />
That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied<br />
Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank<br />
In end of autumn turned to the rams,<br />
And when the work of generation was<br />
Between these woolly breeders in the act,<br />
The skillful shepherd pilled me certain wands,<br />
And in the doing of the deed of kind<br />
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,<br />
Who then conceiving did in eaning time<br />
Fall parti-colored lambs, and those were Jacob’s.<br />
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;<br />
And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.<br />
ANTONIO<br />
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,<br />
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,<br />
But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.<br />
Was this inserted to make interest good?<br />
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?<br />
SHYLOCK<br />
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.<br />
But note me, signior–<br />
ANTONIO, [aside to Bassanio]<br />
Mark you this, Bassanio,<br />
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose!<br />
An evil soul producing holy witness<br />
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<br />
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br />
O, what a goodly outside falsehood

</blockquote>
<p>The key section here is obviously Shylock’s explicit and direct
invocation of the story of Jacob’s production of all the “parti-colored
lambs” (I.iii.79) from Laban’s flock; we read this entire conversation
as saying something quite profound about Jewish vs. Christian ways of
reading the holy texts (this was, again, one of the major “unofficial
interests” that MaKenzie sent my way: she wanted to know what was really
going on between these two major traditions—and she wanted [in this
wonderful way that is so unique to her] to figure this out by <em>going
back to the original texts</em> themselves): Shylock reads Jacob as
showing profound ingenuity, as generative, productive, inventive,
entrepreneurial even, whereas Antonio and Bassanio (our stand-in
Christian characters) read Jacob as usurping an explicitly divine
ability (namely, this very capacity to be generative/creative/etc.). As
I say, not a bad way to tackle the real difference between the Jewish
and Christian “ways of reading.”</p>
<p>Indeed, MaKenzie said to me that this recourse through Shylock’s
mention of the Jacob narrative as exceedingly helpful in parsing out
another scene that occurs in <em>Merchant</em> that might be next to
impossible to grasp without the context provided by the Hebrew Bible. In
II.ii, we get an absolutely bizarre retelling of the Jacob/Esau/Isaac
birthright scenario vis-à-vis Lancelot the clown and his blind old
father. MaKenzie said she was puzzled by this scene, wondering what on
earth was going here, what function it was serving, what it was doing in
the play, and so forth. To be honest—prior to reading these Hebrew texts
with MaKenzie, I was myself always unclear about what to do with this
whole thing. The two of us together had been trying to keep track of the
thread—interwoven all throughout the play—where characters often seem to
be simply “playing out the wishes” of their fathers. Portia, of course,
“plays out the wishes” of her own, <em>dead</em>, father; this
“following the desires of daddy” obviously provides the entire rationale
and impetus for the whole “three caskets” romantic/love plotline, so
famous and so famously treated even by Freud
himself<label for="sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="margin-toggle"/><span

ask—especially given the psychoanalytical dictum about the impossibility
of this—but one cannot help but wonder why one can’t just mourn the
father and let all of his desires go? The scene with Lancelot the clown
and his father—combined with the element of acting and
impersonation—easily led us to thinking about other places where the
Shakespearean signature suggests that if power and authority can be
simulated, can be impersonated—especially when that authority and power
are located squarely within the paternal figure, as the work of Jacques
Lacan so brilliantly
showed<label for="sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-22" class="margin-toggle"/><span

very authority and power and sway can be destabilized and undermined;
this is itself a thread that fully links back up to Shakespeare’s early
play, <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, which is perhaps an even better
place to see this undermining of the Lacanian “paternal function” at
work even more
clearly.<label for="sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-23" class="margin-toggle"/><span

in one of Lacan’s early essays—“Presentation on Psychical Causality,” in

he is a king is mad, a king who thinks he is a king is no less so
[<em>il convient de remarquer que si un homme qui se croit un roi est
fou, un roi qui se croit un roi ne l’est pas moins.</em>]” (p. 139).
Likewise for a father: if the father thinks he is <em>really</em> a
father and nothing more, there is a hint of madness to such a thing akin
to that of the beggar who thinks he is himself really a king.</span></p>
<p>Earlier I said that one way to talk about the intellectual work
MaKenzie and I did during her (very short) time here at USF was by
invoking, somewhat metaphorically, the “line of flight” of Deleuze and
Guattari, where one uses the text only to “leap away from it” in the
pursuit of all kinds of other ideas, texts, concepts, theories, etc. But
perhaps one should stick with this word “text,” which we know comes,
ultimately, from a Proto-Indo-European “root, <em>teks</em>- ‘to weave,
to fabricate, to make; make wicker or wattle
framework’.”<label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="24" class="sidenote">See the Online Etymology Dictionary’s entry for
this word <a

were “leaping away from” the main text only in the hopes of weaving more
threads together—more strands, more connections, more generativity
arising from all those increased connections between all of these
things. I think that the next example here might further flesh this
out.</p>
<h3 id="engl495-directed-study-gender-sexuality-theory">1.1.3 ENGL495:
Directed Study: Gender &amp; Sexuality Theory</h3>
<p>Towards the end of October, for her independent study of “Theories of
Gender and Sexuality” course, we had Zora Neale Hurston’s wonderful
novel, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching
God</em>.<label for="sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="27" class="sidenote"><em>Their Eyes Were Watching God: A Novel</em>
(New York: Perennial, 1990).</span> In the months before October,
MaKenzie and I had been reading <em>a ton</em> of mostly “philosophical”
or “theoretical” works. MaKenzie started us off on this day that she
wasn’t quite sure how to navigate this text, by which she meant how to
navigate through a “fictional” text as opposed to one that was more
philosophical/theoretical. There was perhaps something to this as a good
deal of our time was working through philosophy and theory. (This is of
course not to say that we hadn’t read any literature together. In the
Spring 2022 semester MaKenzie took our ENGL400: Critical Theory course
with Dr. Ioanes—the combination of Dr. Ioanes’ reading list and our
paired work together really lit a fire for MaKenzie. This was especially
true for a work of fiction on that reading list: Henry James’ <em>Turn
of the Screw</em>, a text that MaKenzie will confess she really changed
all kinds of things for her. I like to think that only part of that was
due to James’ text and—perhaps—had much more to do with the fact that
she and I read and thought about this novella a lot together. As I am
looking back here now, this is curious to me as one could say that our
reading together of that work really cemented the two of us as a pair.
We were already extremely close—but it’s somehow possible that that work
brought us even closer.) I jokingly said at the time that I couldn’t
really believe her at all when she said she didn’t really know how to go
at this novel of Hurston’s—and that sentiment was verified simply by the
fact that we spent the next couple of hours (all afternoon, really)
having the most wonderful conversation about this novel. But I’m jumping
ahead of myself slightly here. I said she could feel free to start
somewhat broadly: “What do you think about this novel as a whole? Don’t
worry about pointing to anything super-specific here at the outset,
we’ll get to that in good time.” “It’s a sad book,” she said. “Why?”
“Janie.” “Yes! … Is it a beautiful book?” I asked. “Yes,” she replied.
Good—agreed!</p>
<p>After admitting that this text was assigned to her in high school
(and that she actually read only a few chapters), she said she was happy
to have “saved this text” for us. It’s true, MaKenzie frequently and
often lamented the rather poor and really sub-par educational
experiences she had in high school prior to the two of us crossing paths
(not challenging enough, failed to really push her and her thinking, the
list of sins here is seemingly endless). She did recall a spot in the
text where she wrote about Hurston’s “free indirect discourse” <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech">methodology</a>
in high school and this gave us a nice little opportunity to talk about
this (she said she didn’t recall her teacher ever really defining this
term—I worry that this was really par for the course for MaKenzie’s
academic history, too often she could easily and endlessly produces
examples of situations where her earlier teachers would mention
something and then not proceed to flesh it out) and where it comes from
(for most of us working with the Anglophone literary tradition, the
laurels and rewards for brilliant use of this technique go to

quintessentially novelistic procedure.</span> of course, although one
could easily mention Goethe’s heavy use of it too). After we did that,
we zeroed in on the rather infamous image of the pear tree and the bee,
which orients and constellates so much of the novel, so much so that we
could not help but have recourse to calling it Janie’s “fundamental
fantasy” à la

seems to return to this childhood experience again and again and again

us off by immediately moving to Nanny’s early use of this metaphor:

id="31" class="sidenote">Hurston, p. 15.</span> We continued tracing all
the references to trees, nature, roots, branches, etc. It was very
expertly done on MaKenzie’s part. All while keeping track of this, we
spent a great deal of time talking about Janie’s first and second
husbands, Logan Killicks and Joe (Jody) Starks, respectively, and their
quite different modes of behavior towards Janie, towards work, towards
women and femininity in general, and so forth. Most of our conversation
focused in and around these first two figures and their relations and
impacts upon Janie. The key thread here, at least for me, was one that
centered on Janie’s reactions to the patriarchal structures that are so
visible all throughout this book (there are ways in which these
structures often get propped up by the question of race as well—these
strike me as quite skillfully and subtly done on Hurston’s part, too, I
should add). I know I mentioned already MaKenzie’s (totally unjustified,
from my perspective!) worry about dealing with a fictional text here—but
we ended up reading the text through philosophical and theoretical
lenses that were incredibly generative for both of us.</p>
<p>We talked a great deal about the territory, about the floor plans,
about the blueprint, that Janie’s grandmother, Nanny, lays out for Janie
and her life. Nanny wants “protection” for Janie—and that “protection”
means marriage as the final end, no concerns at all about the means
necessary to achieve that end. The novel clearly invites us to do all
kinds of comparing when it comes to Logan and Joe as husbands: the first
clearly falls into that economic conceptualization given to us by Max
Weber in his <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
Capitalism</em>:<label for="sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="margin-toggle"/><span

(seemingly as much as possible) and the rewards of that work are in the
work itself. Here MaKenzie and I immediately thought of the way in which
Logan says he needs another mule so that Janie can also work the fields;
Janie’s second husband, Joe Starks, clearly espouses a slightly
different form of capitalist ideology, something that associates money
and capital with political power (and which also seems to require Janie
to be put up on a pedestal, no working, just an object of male gazes,
although Hurston’s narrative voice is careful to note that the real gaze
here is Joe’s and Joe’s alone: “That night he ordered [key word choice,
here, for both of us] to tie up her hair around the store. That was all.
She was there in the store for <em>him</em> to look at, not those
others.”<label for="sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-33" class="margin-toggle"/><span

<p>We also discussed at great length Janie’s ultimate dismantling of
Joe’s patriarchal position within the town of Eatonville —this was no
doubt spurred on by the work she and I did on Lacan’s well-known
“formulas of sexuation” where he lays out the differences between

MaKenzie seems to have found the the Lacanian treatment of “masculine
and feminine” structures of sexuation to be very helpful to her in
thinking about what it is that Janie tries to dismantle of said
patriarchal structure. We took a great deal of time focusing in on a
couple of really powerful pages that come in Chapter 6 of the novel.
After telling Janie that he has to tell her what to do because women
don’t think (“Aw naw they don’t [think]. They just think they’s
thinkin’. When Ah see one thing Ah understands ten. You see ten things
and don’t understand one” [p. 68], Jody says), we get the following long
paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Janie stood where he left her for unmeasured time and thought. She
stood there until something fell off the shelf inside her. Then she went
inside there to see what it was. It was her image of Jody tumbled down
and shattered. But looking at it she saw that it never was the flesh and
blood figure of her dreams. Just something she had grabbed up to drape
her dreams over. In a way she turned her back upon the image where it
lay and looked further. She had no more blossomy openings dusting pollen
over her man, neither any glistening young fruit where the petals used
to be. She found that she had a host of thoughts she had never expressed
to him, and numerous emotions she had never let Jody know about. Things
packed up and put away in parts of her heart where he could never find
them. She was saving up feelings for some man she had never seen. She
had an inside and an outside now and suddenly she knew how not to mix
them.<label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="35" class="sidenote">Hurston, pp. 67-68.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I get into reading this passage, I just want to lavish even
more praise on MaKenzie for highlighting this passage. Even after all
the time that has elapsed in between that day and now, I know this still
shouldn’t surprise me too much; she spent so much time here at USF
thinking and reading with me, it only makes sense that she would learn
how to seemingly instantaneously cut right to the very heart of a text
in a way that is identical to the way I myself like to think I do it
(over the course of our time together a million times out of a million
she would pick out the places requiring more thought that were the exact
same ones I myself would want to highlight), so, before I put forward my
own take here, I want to give MaKenzie all the credit here—one should
always give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>Now, I just absolutely love the fact that the passage here in
question refers to a split within Janie (here is, perhaps, the very
birth of her subjectivity): “She had an inside and an outside now and
suddenly she knew how not to mix them.” Ah, perfect. I asked MaKenzie:
can one be a real, actual agent without this split between inside and
outside? “No,” she said. Good—agreed. This break, this split, is perhaps
fully foreshadowed on the previous page, coming immediately after Jody’s
saying that women don’t think: “Times and scenes like that put Janie to
thinking about <em>the inside</em> state of their marriage. Time came
when she fought back with her tongue as best she could, but it didn’t do
her any good. It just made Joe do more. <em>He wanted her submission and
he’d keep on fighting until he felt he had
it</em>.”<label for="sn-36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-36" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="36" class="sidenote">Ibid., p. 67, emphasis mine.</span> This split,
this separation, between outside and inside, does it not set the stage
for Janie’s thorough castration of Jody in Chapter 7: “Naw, Ah ain’t no
young gal no mo’ but den Ah ain’t no old woman neither. Ah reckon Ah
looks mah age too. But Ah’m uh woman every inch of me, and Ah know it.
Dat’s uh whole lot more’n you kin say. You big-bellies round here and
put out a lot of brag, but ‘tain’t nothin’ to it but yo’ big voice.
Humph! Talkin’ ‘bout me lookin’ old! When you pull down yo’ britches,
you look lak de change uh life’”
(p. 75).<label for="sn-37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-37" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="37" class="sidenote">This phrasing, “the change of life,” I’m not
sure it needs glossing, but it refers to menopause (see the OED entry <a
href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/30467?redirectedFrom=change+of+life#eid204188143">here</a>)—and
thus lends credence to a reading focused on sex and sexuality, in
addition to gender too, of course.</span> Everyone sees what’s going on
here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Joe Starks realized all the meanings and his vanity bled like a
flood. Janie had robbed him [again, key word choice, the masculine
structure here obviously would want to read this removal of what Lacan
calls “the
phallus”<label for="sn-38" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-38" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="38" class="sidenote">Once again, see Lacan’s “The Signification of <br />

of theft] of his illusion of irresistible maleness that all men cherish,
which was terrible. The thing that Saul’s daughter had done to David.
But Janie had done worse, she had cast down his empty armor before men
and they had laughed, would keep on laughing. When he paraded his
possessions hereafter, they would not consider the two together. They’d
look with envy at the things and pity the man that owned them. When he
sat in judgment it would be the same. Good-for-nothing’s like Dave and
Lum and Jim wouldn’t change place with him. For what can excuse a man in
the eyes of other men for lack of strength? Raggedy-behind squirts of
sixteen and seventeen would be giving him their merciless pity out of
their eyes while their mouths said something humble. There was nothing
to do in life anymore. Ambition was useless. And the cruel deceit of
Janie! Making all that show of humbleness and scorning him all the time!
Laughing at him, and now putting the town up to do the same. Joe Starks
didn’t know the words for all this, but he knew the feeling. So he
struck Janie with all his might and drove her from the
store.<label for="sn-39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-39" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="39" class="sidenote">Hurston, pp. 75-76.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Now, MaKenzie and I didn’t talk on this day about Janie’s invocation
of the story of David and “Saul’s daughter,” whose name is Michal, but
it is one of my most favorite stories in the Old Testament—it is in <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.6?lang=bi">II Samuel, Chapter
6</a>]—and it’s also a story that Dante picks up on and uses incredibly
strongly and powerfully in Canto X of his
<em>Purgatorio</em>.<label for="sn-40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-40" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="40" class="sidenote">Of course, I deeply adore W. S. Merwin’s
absolutely gorgeous translation of this text, <em>Purgatorio: A New
Verse Translation</em>, trans. W. S. Merwin (New York: Knopf,
2000).</span> This allusion is heavily, heavily, heavily overdetermined
here, it seems to me. It’s not immediately clear to me how one should
take it, given that the original story is complex, alluringly so, I
would say [and this is not even to mention that the history of
interpretations of this story are legion]. Once more: here’s another
quarry to chase within the secondary literature on Hurston’s work.)</p>
<p>It’s very evident that Janie castrates Joe here (thoroughly feminizes
him by suggesting he looks like a woman who is in menopause)—and he
knows it, or, at the very least, he “feels” it, somehow. Indeed, as the
free indirect discourse (again, MaKenzie was the first of us to bring
this out in our conversation) hints at here: “For what can excuse a man
in the eyes of other men for lack of strength?” At the time, I wanted to
try to read Janie here as having a ton of agency in this moment of
castration; MaKenzie was slightly more cautious here, asking if that was
true or if Janie is perhaps somewhat more passive in that she does,
admittedly, “wait for Joe to die” a bit later in the book (unlike the
way she simply leaves Logan for Joe) before taking up with Tea Cake. I
don’t mind that cautious reading too much—but I like the idea of seeing
the split in Janie as the thing that grants her a degree of autonomy and
agency. Although, I confess, that might be too strong.</p>
<p>The rest of our time on this novel was spent discussing this concern
about Janie’s agency (or lack thereof). We managed to keep off for quite
a while the question of how best to read Tea Cake. Does he—as so many
readers and critics have strenuously and vociferously
argued<label for="sn-41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-41" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="41" class="sidenote">Just one example here, see Leila Hajjari,

Studies</em>, Vol. 20., No. 1 (March 2016), pp. 35-52.</span>—not “free”
Janie in some sense from the shackles of patriarchally-imposed
(socioeconomic) power structures? Is this novel not to be read as a
journey, a fundamentally heroic journey, where Janie moves from having
seemingly no voice whatsoever to one that is more “her own”? How does
Tea Cake fit into this dialectic, this journey? Many, many readers and
scholars have focused a great deal on the role of <em>play</em> when it
comes to Janie and Tea Cake’s relationship—they <em>play</em> checkers
together (which Jody never let her do), he teaches her how to shoot a
shotgun—and teaches her so well that becomes a better shot than him:
“She got to the place she could shoot a hawk out of a pine tree and not
tear him up. Shoot his head off. She got to be a better shot than Tea
Cake”
(125).<label for="sn-42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-42" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="42" class="sidenote">See ibid. for a reading that itself focuses on
this “play” aspect.</span> This seems to grant Janie a modicum of
autonomy that she never had with Logan or Joe. We also talked about all
of the numerous ways in which Tea Cake gets linked back up to this theme
of nature—his name is Vergible Woods, after all. I gave MaKenzie a quick
rundown on a number of the “affirmative” readings of this
book<label for="sn-43" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-43" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="43" class="sidenote">Again, see ibid. for a nice survey of many of
these “affirmative” readings.</span>—she found the bar for men to be
incredibly low in many of these readings. Agreed—I am myself not all
that sympathetic to the reading that interprets Tea Cake as a kind of
salvific figure for Janie—sure, he is, in some senses, better to her
than Logan and Joe, but I’m not sure he is without his own
flaws.<label for="sn-44" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-44" class="margin-toggle"/><span

Domination: Their Eyes Were Watching God and the Evolution of
Capitalism,” <em>MELUS</em>, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring, 1999),
pp. 109-128—is highly consistent with my own position.</span> Towards
the end I wanted to know what MaKenzie thought of the whole rabies
storyline at the end of the novel. Did she read Tea Cake’s descent into
a rather terrifying human being as simply the result of the rabies? Or,
alternatively, did she like the idea that the rapid dog’s bite brings
something to the surface that had been simmering under this very same
surface. I quite like that reading. She agreed—and proceeded to have us
take a very close look at the entirety of Chapter 15, which we did as
she said she wanted to read it to me in its entirety. After doing so,
she quipped, “I think that’s all I need to say about the affirmative
readings of Tea Cake.” Not bad—and well-put as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the start of this section, I think we had an
absolutely stellar discussion about this book. There were seemingly an
infinite number of other things we discussed that haven’t found their
way into this write-up. I know we talked <em>ad nauseam</em> about
patriarchal power in this book—especially about the ways in which the
patriarchy appears to be such an incredibly fragile thing: just the
right words chosen (and spoken) by Janie manage to cut Jody right to the
quick. Yet, simultaneously, one wouldn’t want to go so far as to say the
patriarchy was so flimsy that it still couldn’t hit someone and hit them
hard, cause a scar, make them bleed. How is one to think this
fundamental paradox of patriarchal power, best, I asked MaKenzie. So
fragile and yet it hits—and hits <em>hard</em>. Indeed—such a situation
continues to necessitate the task of trying to generate more and more
thoroughgoing critiques of the patriarchy.</p>
<h3 id="engl300-free-speech">1.1.4 ENGL300: Free Speech</h3>
<p>I would bet that it’s probably no doubt already clear how MaKenzie
seemed to always be “in her element” when we were in the office working
together. I think that was especially true for this course, the one that
I really hoped would be <em>very formative</em> for her and her ultimate
goal of pursuing a law degree. For this course, I’d like to rehearse the
work we did on one of the rather famous “Freedom of Speech” cases we
looked at together in this tutorial, <a
href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep485/usrep485046/usrep485046.pdf"><em>Hustler
v. Falwell</em></a>.</p>
<p>MaKenzie started us off with what the main opinion considered to be
the key question here: “This case presents us with a novel question
involving First Amendment limitations upon a State’s authority to
protect its citizens from the intentional infliction of emotional
distress. We must decide whether a public figure may recover damages for
emotional harm caused by the publication of an ad parody offensive to
him, and doubtless gross and repugnant in the eyes of most.” After
confessing that, right at the start (upon reading the description of it
on the very first page of the opinion [p. 46 of the previously linked
.pdf version]), she went to find the ad in question (I’ll link to one <a
href="https://frontpageconfidential.com/larry-flynt-supreme-court-hustler-falwell/">here</a>),
she then proceeded to say she absolutely loved the first footnote in
this case, which reads: “While the case was pending, the ad parody was
published in Hustler Magazine a second time” (49). Already, there was
something just a tad-bit comical to us here—but, all levity aside, the
real questioning—in a very quite-serious and non-jokey way—from MaKenzie
came after she spotlighted a passage on page 46 where Chief Justice
Rehnquist mentions the <em>Abrams v. United States</em>
case,<label for="sn-45" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-45" class="margin-toggle"/><span

argued back in 1919 and one that she and I had already read together
earlier in the year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have therefore been particularly vigilant to ensure that
individual expressions of ideas remain free from governmentally imposed
sanctions. The First Amendment recognizes no such thing as a “false”
idea. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc</em>., 418 U. S. 323, 339 (1974).
As Justice Holmes wrote, “when men have realized that time has upset
many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they
believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good
desired is better reached by free trade in ideas-that the best test of
truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the
competition of the market . . . .” <em>Abrams v. United States</em>, 250
U. S. 616, 630 (1919) (dissenting opinion).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put a smiley face in the margins here of my copy—MaKenzie did too,
surprise-surprise. I wondered aloud to her: “What’s the problem here,
buddy?” “I just want somebody to flesh this out a little bit more—and
I’d like somebody to read a little bit more Nietzsche.” Fair enough, I
replied—indeed, here we see the significant role Nietzsche’s thought has
played for MaKenzie surfacing very clearly and evidently
here.<label for="sn-46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-46" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="46" class="sidenote">See MaKenzie’s “Reflection,” pp. 1-2 for more
on this influence of Nietzsche on her thinking and her work more
broadly.</span> “I would love to know how we’re really cashing-out this
difference between an ‘idea’ and a ‘fact,’” she said. I wanted us to
jump onto this (what for us by this point in the semester had become
something of an “old bugaboo” after reading so many of these SCOTUS
opinions)—i.e. metaphor of the “marketplace of ideas” and its relation
to truth. She said not to get too hasty, “We’ll get to that here in a
second,” she replied. Following my line of thinking really well, she had
us jump over to page 52, where we get the following invocation of
“facts” as they relate to ideas and their possible falsity: “False
statements of fact are particularly valueless; they interfere with the
truth-seeking function of the marketplace of ideas, and they cause
damage to an individual’s reputation that cannot easily be repaired by
counterspeech, however persuasive or effective.” Here again she wanted
some kind of precision with regards to the difference between facts and
ideas. She really leaned heavily on this assertion that “False
statements of fact are particularly valueless …” MaKenzie said—quite
correctly, I should add—that we’re back to Plato here; we tried to
elaborate this a bit more: is the “marketplace of ideas”
rhetoric/metaphor really a Platonic one, I asked her? I was a little
hesitant to sign on to this at first—if only because it seems to me that
there is something about this good ol’ Socratic idea that if “one knows
the Truth,” there’s just no question whatsoever that they’ll chase that
Truth, they’ll pursue it doggedly that needs a lot of unpacking. That
said, there is no doubt an element of the Socratic dialectic that does
require something that looks quite similar to this “marketplace of
ideas” ideology—viz. the testing of claims to Truth, which Socrates
never stops doing in the Platonic dialogues, as we no doubt all know. As
I type up this account here now, I like how slippery this all
is—especially vis-à-vis this connection to Plato. However, I think that
over time I started to feel less and less certain that I need to be
hesitant about this connection MaKenzie unearthed about the
fundamentally Platonic nature of this whole “marketplace of ideas”
rhetoric.</p>
<p>Furthermore, MaKenzie used the text to try to ameliorate this
potential problem of a way-too-implicit and way-too-heavy use of
Platonic thinking by jumping down another sentence on page 52:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But even though falsehoods have little value in and of themselves,
they are”nevertheless inevitable in free debate,” id., at 340, and a
rule that would impose strict liability on a publisher for false factual
assertions would have an undoubted “chilling” effect on speech relating
to public figures that does have constitutional value. “Freedoms of
expression require ‘breathing space.’” <em>Philadelphia Newspapers,
Inc. v. Hepps</em>, 475 U. S. 767, 772 (1986) (quoting <em>New York
Times</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 272).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get her line of reasoning here, perfectly—is this fact/idea
distinction as clean as the opinion suggests it is, she wanted to know.
What assumptions are being made here about facts and about the implied
assertion that one cannot really have a “false idea,” but one can have
(presumably) all kinds of “false facts”? If the “best test of truth is
the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of
the market,” what then do “facts” have to do with this? Of course, as
MaKenzie herself noted, there are all kinds of questions one could pose
to this marketplace metaphor: who gets to participate in this market,
what structures of power and authority influence this market, who really
gets to decide the winners and losers in this competition? If “false
statements are particularly valueless,” how does that work in relation
to the marketplace? Is the main opinion relying on a really strong (and
implicit) injunction that everyone should be able to know which
statements are false and therefore not to be utilized in any market
calculations? Who gets to calculate, who (or what) does the calculating
here? I loved each and every one of these questions. I, for my part,
wanted to really take up this idea that “false statements are
particularly valueless.” I told MaKenzie that I didn’t at all think this
was true. I took up a perhaps very <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek">Žižekian</a>
position here—she said we should go to Nietzsche instead, which we could
and did too, I should note—and said that I think there are all kinds of
falsities that are incredibly powerful and that people invest with <em>a
lot</em> of value—to call them valueless is profoundly begging the
question, at least for
me.<label for="sn-47" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-47" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote" id="47">One
could easily think here of Deleuze and Guattari’s attempt—in
<em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, trans. Mark Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane
(Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1983)—to provide an answer to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich">William Reich’s</a>
infamous question regarding fascism in Hitler’s Germany before World War
II. Eugene W. Holland, in his Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus:
<em>Introduction to Schizoanalysis</em> (New York: Routledge, 1999), is
very clear on this: "The second thesis of schizoanalysis thus helps explain Deleuze and Guattari’s answer to Reich's question regarding fascism: the masses were not tricked; they desired fascism—and fascism wouldn't have succeeded for a moment without that desire, without that libidinal investment. But such investment is not for Deleuze and Guattari a matter of 'ideology,'' of interests misunderstood or led astray. It is rather a matter of desire, and of how and where desire could invest a greater degree of force and power—even from a distance or indeed against one's 'interests': 'the most disadvantaged, the most excluded members of society invest with passion the system that oppresses them, and they always find an interest in it, since it is there that they search for and measure it' (346/415; translation modified). One can posit revolution as the "objective" interest of the masses or the working-class and be perfectly correct; but the real question, the one that schizoanalysis raises with such acuity and tenacity, is under what circumstances that interest corresponds to or becomes their desire, and conversely how that desire can so easily get captured and taken in quite the opposite direction." (103)</span> "Can you give me an example of something false that still has profound power and value," MaKenzie asked. Absolutely—I wanted to say that most ideological positions would fall into this category, but I offered a more specific example by going back to what we talked about in a previous week with Hurston's novel—viz. the patriarchy. Certainly there are tons of people who think that the patriarchal structure is anything but false—but there might be a ton more who fall into the position of the fetishist, into the position of one who says, as Octave Mannoni infamously put it, *Je sais bien, mais quand même* ..., ("I know well, but all the same ..."")<label for="sn-48" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-48" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote" id="48">There's a direct link to Manoni's rather famous essay <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/modernlanguages/applying/undergraduate/crossschool/ln305/biblio/mannoni_i_know_very_well.pdf">here</a>).

<p>I think that the major bone of contention here for us—if I try to
combine my reservations about the whole “marketplace of ideas” thing
with MaKenzie’s concerns about facts and ideas, truth and falseness—is
how one goes about deciding if something (an ad, a spoken utterance, a
caricature of a public figure, whatever) is at all interested in playing
this game of the “marketplace of ideas.” What if some ad or idea or
statement isn’t at all interested in having someone immediately place it
within the “marketplace of ideas”? MaKenzie was herself onto this quite
well, I think, as she knows how her Nietzschean way of thinking asks one
to be really careful about when and how we parse something in terms of
its being a part of this “search for Truth,” which is what the main
opinion says the marketplace helps to facilitate and nurture. I said to
her it’s fine if someone wants to say that everything can be fit under
this rubric of the market, but I do think that this can be seen as
analogous to someone who wears a size ten shoe, but all the shoes on
offer are size six. Sure, you can cram your foot into that thing, but
you’re obviously gonna have to break some toes and other parts of your
foot to get it in that shoe. It’s absolutely true, the legal system here
has a distinctly different conception of language, truth, propositions,
and much more than what MaKenzie has gotten all this Nietzsche and
theory in general together—and that’s not even to mention all the
psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Continuing on with the case’s opinion, we also spent quite a bit of
time talking about some of the examples that the main opinion uses on
pages 54 and 55. The sentence that piqued MaKenzie’s interest (“piqued”
was her word) is the very last one in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon
portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic
depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public
and political debate.Nast’s castigation of the Tweed Ring, Walt
McDougall’s characterization of Presidential candidate James G. Blaine’s
banquet with the millionaires at Delmonico’s as “The Royal Feast of
Belshazzar,” and numerous other efforts have undoubtedly had an effect
on the course and outcome of contemporaneous debate. Lincoln’s tall,
gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt’s glasses and teeth, and Franklin D.
Roosevelt’s jutting jaw and cigarette holder have been memorialized by
political cartoons with an effect that could not have been obtained by
the photographer or the portrait artist. From the viewpoint of history
it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably
poorer without them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MaKenzie really wanted to zero-in on this claim that closes the
quotation above—is it true these caricatures actually contributed at all
to this (admittedly rather vague) idea of “political discourse”? The
opinion states (in quite clear economic language that no doubt keeps it
consistent with the whole rhetoric of the “marketplace” we’ve
highlighted already) that “our political discourse would have been
considerably <em>poorer</em> without them” (italics mine). She was
curious about the examples from the historical record used to
substantiate this remark—she said the <a
href="https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/cartoon-analysis-thomas-nast-takes-on-boss-tweed-1871">Boss
Tweed</a> one seemed easy enough to understand without even having seen
it before—; she was a little unsure about the invocation of <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2011/12/03/143055865/double-take-toons-december-3-1861">Abraham
Lincoln</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2021669741/">Teddy

id="64" class="sidenote"><em>Environmental Humanities</em>, Volume 1
(November 2012), pp. 7-21.</span> I think there’s no doubt that the main
opinion assumes a great deal of familiarity with these images—so much
familiarity that one need not even mention anything specifically or with
any particularity at all about them. MaKenzie wanted to wonder if the
Tweed example could have been sufficient. I get it—my only addition to
this was to say that it seems to me that one would really want the
opinion to talk about all of the ways that, say, for example, the image
of a thin and gangly Lincoln was mobilized by the Confederacy to suggest
a profound degree of weakness (and lack of masculine weight and heft on
Lincoln’s part), but there is no real discussion of the actual effects
of these images on “political discourse.” I also offered to MaKenzie
that it’s possible the justices aren’t interested in getting too bogged
down in the examples, the only function of these examples is to provide
enough of them so that the Falwell ad can be shown to be not all that
“outrageous.”</p>
<p>I know it’s totally bizarre to suggest this, but I can’t help but
think that the major issue here is, again, the claim that all of these
ads are fundamentally “truth-seeking.” I just don’t think that this
method of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes#:~:text=A%20Procrustean%20bed%20is%20an,method%20of%20looking%20for%20clues.">Procrustean
smashing</a> of everything under the banner of “Truth” really continues
to do anything but fatally beg the question for me. I would suggest that
if we think about all language only from within the space of statements
that are truth-oriented (or that are all “under” the category of
“Truth”), then I think we operate with a profoundly poor and paltry
conceptualization of language. MaKenzie agreed and concurred with this
claim. One can—obviously, which MaKenzie did, in fact—take up a critique
and deconstruction of this by going to Nietzsche. This is no undoubtedly
MaKenzie’s bread-and-butter and I think it’s an absolutely fantastic way
to go.</p>
<p>However, another angle came to me as I was listening to a music
album, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everything#2015%E2%80%932016:_Get_to_Heaven"><em>Get
to Heaven</em></a>, by the British band, <em>Everything Everything</em>.
MaKenzie texted this my way after our session, saying that she had
recently “rediscovered” it and that it was quite impactful on her during
her “early high school years.” I gave it a listen and there is a song on
this album, <a
href="https://genius.com/Everything-everything-the-wheel-is-turning-now-lyrics">“The
Wheel (Is Turning Now)”</a>, that has a first line that caught my
attention (probably no doubt simply because I was thinking about all
these Nietzschean arguments that we turned over and over again): “He
held my hand when I died.” I couldn’t help but think what an
interpretation of this line would be like if one had to claim that the
proposition was truth-oriented. Surely, such statements are silly: do
such sentences even have a truth value? You could say sentences like
this are always going to need to be parsed as false. (One can’t help but
think of all the similar kinds of sentences that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a>
loved to trot out again and again when talking about language that has
to get corralled into the regime of truth; the most memorable one is
probably that line from Poe’s “The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar
where the eponymous character says,”I am dead” … indeed, how to
understand such a sentiment in terms of its truth-functionality?) Of
course, language would seem to be rife and absolutely overflowing with
locutions like this. I, once more, feel impelled to go to some sentences
in George Steiner’s fantastic text, <em>After Babel</em>, where he
speaks of language as the greatest tool we have to call bullsh*t (please
forgive my vulgarity here) on this whole ideology that language should
always be assessable in terms of its truth or falsity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My conviction is that we shall not get much further in understanding
the evolution of language and the relations between speech and human
performance so long as we see ‘falsity’ as primarily negative, so long
as we consider counter-factuality, contradiction, and the many nuances
of conditionality as specialized, often logically bastard modes.
<em>Language is the main instrument of man’s refusal to accept the world
as it is.</em> Without that refusal, without the unceasing generation by
the mind of “counter-worlds”—a generation which cannot be divorced from
the grammar of counter-factual and optative forms—we would turn forever
on the treadmill of the present. Reality would be (to use Wittgenstein’s
phrase in an illicit sense), “all that is the case” and nothing more.
Ours is the ability, the need, to gainsay or “un-say” the world, to
image and speak it
otherwise.<label for="sn-49" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-49" class="margin-toggle"/><span

Language <br /> and Translation</em> (New York: Oxford UP, 1975),
pp. 217-18.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot even begin to say how much I love this thought:
“<em>Language is the main instrument of man’s refusal to accept the
world as it is.</em>” Boy howdy—I, perhaps, somehow, love even more this
“ability” of ours to “gainsay or ‘un-say’ the world, to image and speak
it otherwise.”) Absolutely—I couldn’t agree with these ideas more. I
think MaKenzie would be fine with these comments by Steiner and that
they would be very consistent with her usual Nietzscheanism … this is an
image of language as not some thing that merely reflects or mirrors
something out there in reality (indeed, what would a sentence like “He
held my hand when I died” actually reflect “out in the world,” whatever
the heck that means?). Instead, we get language as <em>productive</em>,
incredibly
so.<label for="sn-50" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-50" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote" id="50">I’ve
already mentioned Eugene W. Holland’s <em>Deleuze and Guattari’s
Anti-Oedipus: Introduction to schizoanalysis</em> text, but there is
another spot I read recently that made me instantly think of MaKenzie
and her profound love of Nietzsche. The passage reads as follows
(Holland is talking about Deleuze and Guattari’s conception of desire as
fundamentally <em>productive</em> in the way I’m trying to talk about
language here—and Holland has recourse to an analogy, an analogy that is
fundamentally legal in nature, which is perhaps another reason why it
put me in mind of MaKenzie): "A better sense of the active force of productive desire may be gleaned from forensic usage; desire produces reality in the same sense that lawyers 'produce' evidence in a court of law: they cannot 'wish' it into existence; they don't make it up, but they do make it count as real. Here, too, however, any distinction between what counts as fact, evidence, and reality inside the courtroom and what counts outside it is moot: desire in the schizoanalytic sense produces reality in and of itself, before any such inside–outside distinctions can be drawn. Given this Nietzschean transvaluation of desire as active force, the connection forged by the concept of desiring-machines between desire and labor should appear less perplexing. Through the investment of energy in psychic as well as physical form, desiring-machines produce reality, both in the cognitive sense of psychic drives shaping the phenomenal world and in the economic sense of labor-power shaping the material world." (pp. 22-23)</span>
<p>However, given all that, I still can’t help but wonder if I should
not play devil’s advocate just a little bit with my own reading here. Is
the “marketplace” metaphor perhaps much more amenable to this
“productive” conception of truth than I am willing to allow? Maybe—but
one still gets the feeling from the way the justices utilize this
analogy that the “truth” that the marketplace helps to win out is
somehow known ahead of time. I’m not quite sure what makes me say
that—but the game still seems rigged to me in some way that I can’t
quite fully describe or flesh out or put my finger on precisely. It
strikes me as very significant that the Nietzschean/Deleuzoguattarian
conception of truth <em>not</em> preexist the field in which that truth
ultimately comes to be produced. Otherwise, things do start to sound
eerily Platonic in exactly the way that MaKenzie argued they do—and
Truth becomes the thing that is—possibly—produced within the field of
the market, but in a way that, again, somehow, the justices somehow
already know the outcome of before we even get started.</p>
<p>All right, maybe just one more thing here now (and I’ll try to keep
it as concise as I can): in all of the time MaKenzie and I spent
together working, I was always trying to find ways to give her as many
tools as possible with which to “take something apart,” so to speak. The
Nietzsche angle on all this is absolutely warranted, perfect even. But,
I would be remiss if I didn’t evoke the name of one of the other
philosophers who became quite a touchstone for us, especially given how
pronounced this “marketplace” rhetoric is here—of course, I’m thinking
here of Marx. (MaKenzie didn’t mention him by name, but when she voiced
her question about who exactly gets to participate in this “market,” one
could imagine that she had Marx in mind.) I have a trio of texts that I
read over this past summer—largely in preparation for all the courses
MaKenzie and I were scheduled to do that next Fall—that I would want to
invoke here. In terms of the order I came across them, they are Thomas

id="54" class="sidenote">William Clare Roberts, <em>Marx’s Inferno: The
Political Theory of Capital</em> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 2018). All
citations to this work will appear parenthetically in text.</span> These
texts are copious in their length, so I’ll try to grossly oversimplify
things here by going right to the very heart of the matter as it
pertains to the marketplace metaphor within this legal sphere MaKenzie
and I found ourselves working on week after week after week for this
ENGL300 course.</p>
<p>Nail’s text is largely concerned with Marx’s thoughts on value under
capitalism. As a nice little <em>précis</em>, we could look at page
78:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Marx, the conditions of value do not resemble what they
condition: value itself. If they did, we would have explained nothing.
We would have a mere tautology, found in many “labor theories of value.”
In other words, the conditions for the capitalist mode of production are
not and cannot resemble capitalism itself or even the merely social
relations between humans. This is why there is no rational or formulaic
proportion between labor (which has no value) and value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elaborating further, Nail notes—correctly, to my mind—:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is also why Marx’s historical mode of inquiry begins with
colonialism and primitive accumulation in the first place—something
value theorists often leave out. Capitalism emerges from the historical
conditions of the noncapitalist process of direct appropriation, murder,
theft, colonialism, demineralization, and so on: “Capital comes dripping
from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt” (<em>C</em>,
926). Capitalist value is dripping with the blood of all the indigenous
people it killed and with all the minerals it stole from their land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I cite these passages is just to make clear that this
invocation of the market is not without consequences and quite serious
complications. Nail’s text allows one to say something like the
following: “There’s no simple or self-evident way for one to move from
the use-values of a thing within the market to the thing’s price—these
two things are not at all smooth or glaringly self-obvious or clear.”
Indeed, MacGilvray’s text doubles down on this idea even more strongly
than Nail’s does—and Roberts’s text really illustrates the full power
and potential of this “invention” of the marketplace’s becoming
synonymous with “freedom” (a sphere free of coercion—this sphere, as
MaKenzie has always liked to note, <em>is not free from coercion</em>,
of course).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The measure of value, according to Marx, is the labor time socially
necessary to produce the valuable commodities given the current means of
production. But, as I argued in the previous chapter, it is a basic
element of Marx’s theory of value that value, while it is determined by
labor time, only ever appears as exchange value, as “the social relation
between commodity and commodity.” There is no direct, empirical measure
of labor time, since there is no way to know whether any given instance
of labor actually performed—and hence empirically measurable—counts as
an equivalent amount of socially necessary labor. Moreover, the fact
that commodities sell on the market does not guarantee that they sell at
their value. (122)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the degree of uncertainty here—will my labor be valuable
<em>at all</em>?—is a distinct existential terror (one could say) that
is baked-in to capitalism as a system of what Roberts’s calls
“impersonal domination”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marx finds two wrongs inherent in capitalism considered as a
commercial society. First, because value is determined by abstract,
socially necessary labor time, no producer can know until after the fact
whether or not their labor was productive at the socially necessary
level. This exposes every producer’s judgment to a form of uncertainty
and compulsion that makes him or her act incontinently. <em>Second, this
exposure to the market renders each producer a slave to the decisions of
others, made without consultation or debate. The preferences of others
impose themselves on each producer without any need to justify
themselves, and without any possibility of being contested.</em> There
is no way to ask whether the activities that set the terms of sale are
themselves worthwhile. (101)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roberts’s argument here is that it’s quite silly to say that the
marketplace is a space and place of freedom; moreover, his argument
completely and totally gives the lie to the way the majority opinion
utilizes this metaphor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is not that individuals cannot do exactly what they each
want to do [when playing the market game], but that they cannot get
together and talk about what sorts of things that should and should not
be done, and what sorts of reasons should and should not count as good
reasons. Having to take the beliefs and desires of others into account
is, in itself, no threat to one’s freedom; the question is whether one
can challenge those beliefs and desires before having to take them into
account. … Hence, although although people continue to make decisions
based on their beliefs and desires, these beliefs and desires are not
especially salient as explanatory factors, because the macroregularities
of market societies—all of the tendencies or laws of economic
development—will hold regardless of which individuals play which parts.
The great irony of modern market societies is that they give rise to the
cult of the individual at the same time that, through their
institutional order, they render the specificity of any individual
irrelevant to social scientific explanation. What matters for the
predictable dynamics of modern economy is that there are individuals.
<em>Who</em> those individuals are does not matter at all. (96-97)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so much here in Roberts’s book that is so germane to me
here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marx’s attention is not on the identifiable person with whom I am
transacting business, but on all of the unknown buyers and sellers whose
choices have established the parameters of this transaction. By focusing
narrowly on the personal interaction, the defenders of the market have
missed the drama of the situation entirely. The defenders worry about
the possibility that a <em>monopolist</em> might threaten the freedom of
market agents; hence, the freedom of the market is only threatened by a
force alien to—and, supposedly, ameliorated by—market competition.
Marx’s worry is about the threat to freedom posed by a market agent’s
competitors and customers, and hence about a threat to freedom proper to
the market as such, and which would be more of a threat the more perfect
the market became. (99)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forgive me here, but the following paragraph is where I want to
ultimately get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buyers and sellers on the market are not asked to justify their
preferences for money or goods. I think it is safe to say that we would
all find it very strange if the cashier at a store asked us to supply
reasons for our purchases: “Why do you want that? Do you really think it
is the best thing for you?” <em>If anything, we expect our counterparts
in exchange to justify our desire for us, to give us a litany of reasons
for wanting what they have to offer. To a large extent, we offer money
and commodities in exchange precisely as an alternative to offering
reasons for wanting what we want.</em> (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then—all right, last citation, I promise—we get this wonderfully
nice little footnote: “Much commentary on this passage [from Smith’s
<em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, bk. 1.I.ii] focuses on the way in which
the market offer is a sort of reason-giving. What is occluded here is
the difference between offering an <em>incentive</em> to do what I want
(market offers) and offering you <em>grounds</em> for doing what I want
(offering reasons)” (100). I find this critique incredibly convincing
and devastating, in so many ways—how cute it is to think that the market
is a space where people <em>offer reasons</em> for things. I have so
much more to say here, I’m sure—but think I’ll cut the thread here
now.<label for="sn-55" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-55" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="55" class="sidenote">I might also submit to the record here that the
very next week we read the <a
href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/88-155"><em>Texas v.
Johnson</em></a>, 491 US 397 (1989), where we returned once more to this
marketplace metaphor yet again; it was insanely fascinating to both of
us to see the dissenting opinion quite explicitly say that there are
some things, ideas, symbols, that <em>do not play within the marketplace
game</em>.</span></p>
<p>What’s the main idea here with all of this? My only point is not
simply to illustrate the content—what we studied together—but
<em>how</em> we studied together. MaKenzie mentioned one day towards the
end of the semester she had been thinking some more about that thing
Joe/Jody says to Janie about women and thinking: “Aw naw they don’t
[think]. They just think they’s thinkin’. When Ah see one thing Ah
understands ten. You see ten things and don’t understand one.” She said
she thought one of the great things that the two of us did when we
worked and thought together was something very much like what Jody says
women don’t ever really do—namely, we read all these dense or wonderful
texts, and then we find all of these spots we want to talk about and,
ultimately, we try to link all of those different spots to one key idea
or thread or point or whatever. I agree—so wholeheartedly. It is indeed
a really beautiful and wonderful thing that didn’t take us all that long
to learn how to do. It made me so pleased and proud to know that she saw
this whole process in a very similar, if not identical, way to the way I
looked at it.</p>
<p>That said, I did offer to her that I think we also managed to do the
other thing that Jody talks about: we start with this one text or court
opinion or play or whatever and proceed to show how we understand not
just one thing using this text, but so many things that it gets
difficult to count and enumerate them all when the day is done. We can
thus look at one thing and see ten. When she brought up this passage,
she initially said that Joe’s self-description here is very consistent
with his capitalist leanings: always wanting to take the one thing and
then produce ten from it. I myself ventured to say that it would seem
important for us to draw a distinction here: we do ourselves engage in
this generative multiplication—of readings, of interpretations—but not
really for any hope of profit, but just because difference is so
important to the way we think. We are always connecting, always
multiplying perspectives, in good Nietzschean fashion—so I didn’t want
Jody’s capitalist ideology to get any kind of monopoly on this
multiplicative phenomenon. Of course, I’d also like us to be able to
do—and I think this was incredibly easy with MaKenzie as a
thinking/conversation partner—the thing he says Janie—and women in
general—can’t do: see ten things and push to something that runs through
all those things. I would hope that this “reflection” here is a
wonderful testament to MaKenzie’s ability to move in both directions.
Ten times out of ten I rather felt as if she was carrying me with her on
this journey, so I’m hesitant to give myself much credit for it.</p>
<h3 id="engl497-senior-thesis">1.1.5 ENGL497: Senior Thesis</h3>
<p>Before transitioning fully here, I want to carve out a moment here to
“take stock” of things so far. I think that what has really become
incredibly clear to me after working very closely with MaKenzie is that
it’s not quite enough for one to just “learn the content,” as one says.
I think that it is a profoundly different thing—a profoundly different
experience—to learn how to “think <em>with</em> another person.” I know
we all like to think that when we come together in the classroom, or we
come together in the conference rooms around this university, that we
are actually thinking <em>with</em> other people. I should say—and I am
trying mightily to not make this sound as if I’m cruelly just “throwing
shade” here—but ten times out of ten I feel as if we are just thinking
<em>with</em> others “who are in close spatial proximity to us.” But
this is not actually <em>thinking with</em> another at all. Even in
conversations with deeply cherished colleagues, I could still detect the
traces of us not necessarily thinking <em>with</em> but merely thinking
<em>alongside</em> or thinking <em>near</em> the other. No doubt this
can be attributed to my own idiosyncratic personality, but two years’
worth of thinking with MaKenzie really got me wondering if I had ever
really—outside of my relationship with my own mentor, I should say, who
is the only other person with which I managed to forge this kind of
connection, and, somehow, MaKenzie managed to do it even better than he
did—learning to <em>think in rhythm</em> with another person. (Of
course, in the sections below that deal with William D. Mastin’s work, I
should add his name to this very short list of people who have managed
to learn how to “think <em>with</em> me.”)</p>
<p>I am well-aware that many people need a good deal of time to even
begin to figure out to “think <em>near</em> another” let alone fully
<em>with</em> another. Indeed, many people really never find someone or
learn how to “think with” that other person. Somehow, MaKenzie and I
just didn’t ever seem to need much time to learn that at all. This is
something that, I noticed too, MaKenzie herself was aware of and thought
similarly about—this is her, again, from her “Senior Thesis Capstone
Reflection,” talking about how even before our flurry of work in the
Fall semester, we had already built a rapport and trust that was
absolutely unique and singular for both of us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two of us had already set quite a foundation for working and
thinking together before I even thought about finishing early and taking
an expedited path. I would often leave my classes and head straight for
his office, where we would talk about whatever I had been tasked to
read; he would often help me unlock parts of texts that I never would
have been able to access alone, which is something I had never found in
a conversation partner before. When it came time to work on our various
independent and directed studies together, it was an easy adjustment.
Talking about things in such a deeply analytical way has always come so
naturally to us, even from our first meeting where I told him that
Polonius was my favorite Shakespeare character. Right from the very
beginning of our first independent study, entitled “Style”, I felt that
my love for learning had been reignited; rather, the wick had been
totally replaced: this was not a type of learning I had ever experienced
but it was so much more fun and enriching than the learning I had come
to take as the only
option.<label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="25" class="sidenote">Munson, “Reflection,” p. 1.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>MaKenzie says that she found a “conversation partner” in me that she
had never quite encountered before in her academic travels; I would be
more than willing to say that the exact same thing was true for me.
There was nothing that we could not figure out how to use this to
ultimately do. Once one learns the kinds of rhythms by which another
person’s thinking moves and makes its way through the world, there is
never a time when that can’t be leveraged for profound intellectual
work. I cannot help but think here of that wonderful little aphorism of
Nietzsche’s about thinking and its connection to <em>movement</em>,
poking fun at Flaubert: “<em>On ne peut penser et écrire qu’assis</em>
[one can’t think and write unless one is seated] (Gustave Flaubert).—Now
I’ve got you, you nihilist! Ass-iduity [<em>Sitzfleisch</em>] is the
<em>sin</em> against the Holy Spirit. Only thoughts that come by
<em>walking</em> have any
value.”<label for="sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-26" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="26" class="sidenote">Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Twilight of the Idols:
Or, How to Philosophize with the Hammer</em>, trans. Richard Polt
(Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 1997), p. 10, fragment #34.</span> So
many thinkers—Nietzsche says Socrates is the consummate exemplar of this
tendency—like to envision thinking as a process where one does do some
walking and traveling—but the goal is always to get somewhere safe and
sound and secure, somewhere the thinker can come to then just sit.
MaKenzie’s thinking—long before meeting me, I would bet—seems to have
imbibed and deeply internalized this Nietzschean preference for
movement—for very intense movement—, for picturing thinking as a kind of
dance, where the goal is never to get to some place so that one can then
just sit there. Always in movement, always becoming something different,
never static, always <em>dynamic</em> and always <em>in
process</em>—this is MaKenzie’s way of thinking, to my mind. I think
it’s the only real way to be and, again, I’ve never, ever seen a student
do it so well as her. Obviously, it’s not enough to just sit there and
watch the dancer dance—instead, one must feel the need to get into the
rhythms of the other’s thinking: how does it move, what are its moment
of pause and rest like, where does its intensity and velocity speed up
and slow down, how does it ultimately want <em>to work</em>? This is
what MaKenzie and I managed to do … and managed to learn how to
do—always—<em>together</em>.</p>
<h4 id="composing-the-first-draft">1.1.5.1 Composing the First
Draft</h4>
<p>Transitioning here just slightly, I would like to move on to what all
of this wonderful work ultimately culminated in for the two of us
together. Such a thing is easy to do—and it comes in the form of our
co-authored piece (the first of many, many articles I know she and I are
planning to write together now that her graduation day this past
December has come and gone) on Lydia Millet’s recent novel, <em>A
Children’s Bible</em> (which also served as one of the artifacts for her
“Senior Thesis Capstone” for the English
major.<label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="11" class="sidenote">The final, second, draft of this essay,
“‘Holmes, that’s some Santa Claus shit’: Reading Lydia Millet’s <em>A

available <a

This piece has been accepted for publication and inclusion within
<em>The Routledge Handbook of Crime Fiction and Ecology</em>, which will
be published in April of this year. By this point in time, it might be
already all too clear—however, I would like to voice it here once
more—but MaKenzie is by far the only student that I would have ever
considered coauthoring an essay together with—and I know for a fact that
a published essay in a collection from a publisher that is no
slouch—especially when it comes to the field of literature, philosophy,
etc.—will look incredibly good on her CV/Resume when it comes time for
her to apply to law school or wherever else her future might take her.
This is not even to mention that the number of twenty-year olds who can
boast such a thing are frighteningly few and far between. The essay has
already been through the first round of editorial review; we have
already finished (as of this writing) the second full draft
incorporating the editor’s suggestions/edits; Dr. Ashman, the editor of
this work, continues to be incredibly excited about the opportunity of
including the work in his collection. Few students ever really get such
a “trial by fire” crash course in academic writing at the undergraduate
level. Even fewer is the number of twenty-year old students who can
handle such a thing with the skill and rather staggering degree of sheer
brilliance that MaKenzie showed every single step of the way throughout
this entire
project.<label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="12" class="sidenote">The fullest treatment of this entire project
can be found <a
href="%225_supporting_materials/a_student_work/i_millet_essay_project_materials/post_writing_reflections/kas_reflection.pdf%22">here</a>
in my “Reflections on MaKenzie Munson and Dr. Spicer’s Co-Authored Essay
on Lydia Millet’s <em>A Children’s Bible</em>—Supporting Materials for
MaKenzie’s Senior Thesis Capstone Requirement for the English Degree.”
Now seems as good a moment as any to note that this “Reflection” on our
shared project crystallizes perfectly the changes in my pedagogical
philosophy and ethos over the years since receiving tenure; furthermore,
MaKenzie (once again) was the impetus and force that pushed this
crystallization. I also hope to not mechanically and laboriously repeat
myself here in this reflection—I could have easily imagined a “Tenure
Review Portfolio” that simply said: “See this other essay for everything
curious readers are inquisitive about in terms of my pedagogy and ethos
of teaching.” I will hope that here—in this slightly different context—I
can manage to say some things that I don’t exactly say in that other
piece.</span> As I say, such things are so exceedingly rare—it is very
difficult to describe how rare. That said, there’s no doubt whatsoever
in my mind that MaKenzie is one in a bazillion.</p>
<p>I hope that it is already clear that MaKenzie has an incredibly sharp
capacity for reading and interpretation; of course, at the same time,
her facility with the written word is equally unmatched when I think
back on all the students I’ve taught in my (now rather long) teaching
career. MaKenzie produced–as a <em>very young</em> undergraduate
student—scholarly writing (under my mentorship and guidance) that will
meet (is already meeting) some incredibly rigorous and exacting
standards. All teachers dream of getting students’ writing capacities to
one day be up to such standards: we almost never achieve it before they
leave us at the undergraduate level. MaKenzie more than accomplished
such a thing even before she received her BA. No doubt this was all
helped by the profound degree of rapport and trust fashioned between
MaKenzie and myself that I have already tried to highlight here in this
“review.” I have never encountered anyone who thought quite as similarly
to me as her; I have also never encountered someone whose writing style
is such a perfect fit with my own. While reflecting on the entire
process that led to this soon-to-be-published article, MaKenzie noted
something this past December that I would be remiss if I did not share
it with the committee members here in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something I find so interesting when reading the paper again, as a
finished draft (awaiting edits from Dr. Ashman [who is the editor of the
collection]), is how seamlessly our two styles fit together. It feels
impossible to me to point out distinct moments that one of us
individually wrote – both because of our shared thought-work on all
aspects of the project and also because our writing seems to flow
together so well. Style is something that I think is so singular and
unique but I find myself second-guessing that definition while reading
this paper. I don’t find this to be a bad thing at all; on the contrary,
this fact even further solidifies my confidence in this paper and my
hope that we can continue writing together even after my time as a
student here comes to an end. I truly think that we have a special way
of working and writing together and that we have some incredibly
important things to
say.<label for="sn-56" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-56" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="56" class="sidenote">Munson, “Reflection,” p. 7.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not have said it better myself—I do think that she and I
“have a special way of working and writing together.” This has, by far,
been the highlight and pinnacle of my career as a teacher and an
educator. And there is no question whatsoever that this absolutely
singular experience was all due to MaKenzie’s strengths as a thinker,
reader, and writer. She will say that so much of this was due to me—and
she has been tirelessly working to get me to accept this and to never
shortchange my own contributions and impacts on her. I am not so sure of
that. I think that she came my way with a mind that was already
<em>so</em> sharp—by far the sharpest mind I have ever encountered in
all my years of teaching—and I think that if I have done anything at all
for her, it was simply to help make this mind even sharper.</p>
<p>Trying to actually avoid the “mechanical and laborious repetition” of
all I wrote in my reflection for her Senior Thesis Capstone, I would
like to cite a long passage, again, from her own “Reflection” where she
acknowledges something that was exceedingly important to this entire
endeavor, but it was not a facet that I myself spoke too much about in
my own “Reflection.” The context here has MaKenzie transitioning a bit
between all of the work we did in our courses and how it all related to
the task of co-authoring the paper together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While all of the previous sections may seem superfluous or not
pertinent to the task of reflecting on my senior thesis, I find it so
important to look at the full process of writing this paper; it just so
happens that this process was a lot more involved than others may see at
surface level. Beyond the largely unconscious work that occurred within
my class readings, Spicer and I started tackling the discussion of this
book really early on. I think there were a lot of things that were super
obvious to us upon initial readings of this book [Millet’s <em>A
Children’s Bible</em>]; for example, the myriad analogies and
connections to religious texts, the importance of the guessing game, and
the message this novel sends about the climate crisis. What was (and
still is!) always so wonderful about our conversations is that I never
feel like Spicer is talking down to me; and the moments where I taught
him something or pointed out something he hadn’t seen are incredibly
genuine. It was rarely even that one person had something specific to
teach or show the other – our conversations were almost always the most
generative part of the thinking and writing process. There was always
something so rewarding about the moments where we made connections or
decoded something together; that shared triumph is something I feel can
be so lacking in the humanities, where a relative seclusion is more
often the case for
scholars.<label for="sn-57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-57" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="57" class="sidenote">Ibid., “Reflection,” p. 6.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sentence I want to focus on here is the one that reads: “What was
(and still is!) always so wonderful about our conversations is that I
never feel like Spicer is talking down to me; and the moments where I
taught him something or pointed out something he hadn’t seen are
incredibly genuine.” I spoke earlier of the way in which the two of us
happened to “instantly trust one another in a very deep way.” I can
easily imagine that one could really make an argument that when it comes
to teachers and their students, there are all kinds of imbalances and
asymmetries between each of the people in the pair. Can a teacher really
put themselves on the exact same level as their student? Can a student
with far less experience and expertise actually manage to rise to the
exact same level as a seasoned scholar? I can easily envision saying
that such things really cannot happen, no matter how often the teacher
or student might want to say that they worked together as <em>fully</em>
equal partners on a collaborative project. I think that it is more than
possible that if I had worked on this project with any other student but
MaKenzie, I would find these arguments to be ones that would deserve a
hearing. However, in her case, there is no way whatsoever that such
lines of argumentation could hold any water—at all. There are so many
things that I am exceedingly proud of MaKenzie for over her time with me
here at USF (and, I know for a fact that as she moves further and
further into her own future, this number is only going to increase each
and every day). One of the most significant things that make me so proud
of her is how she worked with me on this project. There was never, ever,
a moment where a potential imbalance or inequality between the two of us
meant that I had to, in some sense, “carry her” along with me through
the journey. When she writes that “[i]t was rarely even that one person
had something specific to teach or show the other—our conversations were
almost always the most generative part of the thinking and writing
process. There was always something so rewarding about the moments where
we made connections or decoded something together …”—she is absolutely
right and tells the truth absolutely perfectly. I never, ever had to
carry her—I never, ever had to do things that MaKenzie couldn’t do
solely on her own—the load was completely and totally equal. To be
honest, it might be much more truthful to say that there were countless
moments where she carried me—although this metaphor of “carrying” is
probably not the best one: goodness knows I hit so many roadblocks in my
own thinking trying to wrestle with all of the texts and ideas and
theories that we marshaled in the composition of this article. I know I
cited one of MaKenzie’s remarks earlier about how I “would often help
[her] unlock parts of texts that [she] never would have been able to
access alone, which is something [she] had never found in a conversation
partner before.” Ten times out of ten MaKenzie helped me “unlock parts
of [these] texts that <em>I</em> never would have been able to access
alone”—and, there’s no doubt whatsoever that this too was “something
<em>I myself</em> had never found in a conversation partner before”
either. I learned <em>so much</em> by and through working with
MaKenzie—it would be impossible to really explain fully just how much I
learned. There’s little doubt in my mind, that something special was
always occurring here between the two of us—she learned how to do all
kinds of things on her own that, perhaps, did ultimately come from me,
but that didn’t install any of these imbalances/inequalities between us
as a pair. We worked in a space <em>in between</em> the two of us—always
incredibly mutually and
reciprocally.<label for="sn-58" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-58" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="58" class="sidenote">I tried heartily and mightily to explain this
“working in <em>the space of the between</em>” in my already frequently
cited “Reflection” on this article/project—pages 12-14 are especially of
note here on this concern.</span></p>
<h4 id="revising-the-first-draft-composing-the-second-draft">1.1.5.2
Revising the First Draft, Composing the Second Draft</h4>
<p>At the time that my reflection on the project was composed, we had
only recently sent it along to the editor (<a
href="https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/nathan-ashman">Dr. Nathan
Ashman</a>), who was a huge fan of it and a great supporter of the work
MaKenzie and I did to create the essay. Over the months since that
finals week in December, MaKenzie and I have spent a good deal of time
working on Dr. Ashman’s suggested revisions. Since those weren’t yet
completed at the time of my earlier reflection, I would like to speak to
this part of the scholarly writing process here now. Dr. Ashman’s
editorial comments were not only incredibly good, but became really
generative for both MaKenzie and myself as we tackled the task of
revision. As MaKenzie will no doubt be willing to admit—again, something
that I find she one-hundred percent shares with me—the “revision” part
of writing is one that has always left her with a somewhat lackluster
feeling. Given the fact that both of us can’t help but feel a little
curmudgeonly when it comes to this part of the process, one could easily
guess that this part of the journey would be a tad bit difficult and
challenging for us as a pair. I think I should give a huge shout-out
here to Dr. Ashman, as his commentary really helped us out
immensely.</p>
<p>There were three essential points of clarification that Dr. Ashman
suggested we try to attend to as we moved from our first to second
draft. These points were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 – [T]he first section of the essay focuses on what you term the
“oedipal detective game” and I think this would benefit from a little
more development. It wasn’t entirely clear to me what this game actually
entails (within the logic of the novel) and why you land on this
psychoanalytic designation. It’s a provocative idea, but perhaps feels a
little undertheorised as it stands. So perhaps you could spend an
additional short paragraph unpacking the specifics of this game and why
it is being termed an ‘oedipal detective game’.<br />
2 – I think you could also spend a little more time unpacking Deleuze’s
discussion of crime fiction, particularly what he means by the ‘classic’
detective novel. What is he referring to specifically, here? The
nineteenth century detective novel? The golden age novel? <br />
3- When discussing the resolution of the novel and what this means in
relation to questions of truth/justice, it might be useful to bring in
some secondary criticism that discusses these ideas in the context of
crime fiction studies. Sam Walton’s intro to the ‘Crime and Ecology’
issue of <em>Green Letters</em> might be useful
here.<label for="sn-59" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-59" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="59" class="sidenote">Nathan Ashman, personal communication, <br /> December
22, 2022.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This here is really generous editorial commentary. Not only that, but
Dr. Ashman very willingly gave us a bunch more words with which to
figure out how we wanted to address these three items. The original word
count for the essays in the CFP was 7500 words—after some nice back and
forth between Dr. Ashman and myself (where I openly confessed that
MaKenzie and I both felt like we didn’t just have one essay here that we
easily could have composed, but had, rather, maybe something like three
or even four)—he increased our word limit, which is something I have
found most editors will do only begrudgingly or with, at least, quite a
bit of hemming and hawing. I should also grant that MaKenzie and I both
found Dr. Ashman’s comments to be incredibly perceptive, very
perspicacious: these three spots were indeed areas where we felt the
weight of the word count working on us; these were indeed things that we
had talked about already. It’s always nice to get something from another
reader—a third-party observer, so to speak—that feels confirmatory in
this way—as no doubt all of us scholars fully know. As MaKenzie and I
spoke about together so often, neither of us were quite sure, when we
started this whole thing, whether or not any of it would actually work
out in the end—everything here about this was frighteningly speculative,
I think, if I’m totally
honest.<label for="sn-60" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-60" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="60" class="sidenote">I should probably try to be as fair and
forthright here as possible. I am pretty sure that MaKenzie might have
been far more confident—and found this whole thing to be far less
speculative and uncertain—about all of this than I was at the outset. I
tried to speak to this uncertainty on my part in my “Reflection,”
<em>op. cit.</em>, pp. 17-18 in particular. I know I have already cited
MaKenzie’s reflection comment that after we decided we would have her
take an “expedited path” towards graduation, she confessed: “I would
like to say that I was wary for a brief moment about this proposition,
but that would be untruthful; I was super excited to jump into my last
year with the support of someone I had grown to admire and look up to so
much at USF” (p. 1). I would bet that she felt very similarly about
embarking on this whole Millet paper project. It would seem that I was
far more uncertain about this than MaKenzie—which is no doubt yet
another indicator of her own strength of character, that’s for sure. I
should say that I also noted in my “Reflection” that if the project was
successful, I was going to take it as a precedent etched in stone for
our continuing to work and write together long into the future. At the
time of this writing, this is indeed still my position.</span></p>
<h5 id="shoring-up-the-oedipal-detective-game">1.1.5.2.1 “Shoring-Up”
the “Oedipal Detective Game”</h5>
<p>In the previous section, I spoke of the way in which MaKenzie always
helped me enormously think through things. This was fully on display
here as—again, well after her graduation day in December had come and
gone—we leapt into deep waters in order to address Dr. Ashman’s
suggestions for revision. Now, it is true that the final section of the
essay, “3. Weaving Together Inconsistent Threads,” where we try to get
the first two sections of the paper to gel and jive with one another, a
good bulk of that was “written by me” (keeping in mind, once more, that
there’s no possibility of really saying that “I alone” wrote X, Y, or
Z—everything was written by us, together, in some way, shape, or form),
thus, it made some degree of sense that I would be the one to tackle
Dr. Ashman’s point 3. (That said, this third section has always been a
little knotty for us—it often gave us some trouble, if I’m being totally
candid.) Now, in fact, it could have been really easy to say points 1
and 2 were MaKenzie’s territory—as she was “the one that wrote-up”
[again, massive caveats are needed for that phrasing]) the sections
focusing on the “oedipal detective game” and also was the one to heavily
(and very brilliantly, I should say) utilize Deleuze’s “Philosophy of
Crime Novels” essay
there.<label for="sn-61" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-61" class="margin-toggle"/><span

total, where I know I thought to myself: “Okay, easy breezy—I’ll just
(finally) figure out how to handle that third section problem and then
let MaKenzie handle the revisions to beef- and bulk-up the whole
‘oedipal detective game’ and Deleuze crime fiction things.” I say that I
probably only spent thirty seconds thinking about this solely
because—again, full disclosure—I wasn’t entirely certain how to think
about all of
this.<label for="sn-62" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-62" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="62" class="sidenote">This was actually something that came up in
conversation with Drs. Ioanes and Popp, and Dean McDermott, when all
five of us were able to spend some time together having MaKenzie and I
present our work to the English faculty this past December. Dr. Ioanes
herself was onto this gap in our paper (I was about to say “weakness,”
but I’m not sure—given certain constraints that we had at the time—that
word is quite applicable; I suppose it is a “weakness,” but certainly an
understandable one, I would say, given all the other parameters of this
project).</span> As I say, neither of us did anything in the whole time
this project took to complete that looked like just one of us tackling a
particular thing. We always did it together, as a pair, and thus I
quickly figured that it would be odd to change tactics and techniques
here at this point—the way we had done it so far was working incredibly
well.</p>
<p>We took one long afternoon in January to talk through Dr. Ashman’s
three concerns, tossing back and forth together in dialogue how we
wanted to proceed forward. As was so par for the course, we talked
through each of the parts and pitched some ideas. That conversation
produced an outline of ideas that looked roughly like the following
(I’ll separate out the three major critiques into their own sections
below).</p>
<h6 id="further-theorizing-the-oedipal-detective-game">1.1.5.2.1.1
Further Theorizing the “Oedipal Detective Game”</h6>
<p>With regards to point 1., as I already admitted, our creation—and use
of—this “Oedipal detective game” concept could definitely have benefited
from some strengthening. I told MaKenzie that I thought the work of
well-known ecological/environmental philosopher Timothy Morton could be
really helpful for us on this front. However, I made the case that we
would definitely have to be very careful in the way that we utilized his
work here to flesh out the “Oedipal” side of this detective game. I have
found Morton’s ecocritical work to be very fruitful—but this work is not
something that we could easily just use in any kind of simple way. This
is due, at least for me, to some of the many problematic positions that
Morton has taken up in his work vis-à-vis psychoanalysis in
general.<label for="sn-63" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-63" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="63" class="sidenote">I should disclose here that I myself am already
“on the record” here in terms of criticisms of Morton’s understanding of
Lacan in particular. See my own “<em>L’extermination</em> <em>de tout

‘Apparatus’ and its Implications for Ecological Thinking,” in <em>Lacan
and the Nonhuman</em>, eds. Jonathan Dickstein and Gautam Basu Thakur
(New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), pp. 101-120 for a (short,
admittedly) treatment of Morton and his take on Lacanian
psychoanalysis.</span> MaKenzie was game for giving the Morton a shot,
but was a bit hesitant, I think, largely because I have a rather
passionate take on the whole psychoanalysis angle. I have never thought
that part of my job of training MaKenzie was to get her to just—either
too simply or too dogmatically—take up my positions wholesale. She never
took up positions or sides of an argument simply because they were
mine—and although we are very close in so many ways, she was never one
to show any interest whatsoever in simply mechanically imitating me and
my own philosophical/theoretical loyalties. I have always put her own
intellectual autonomy first and—her knowing that very fact—, she was
eager to read some of Morton’s texts on her own. As per usual, MaKenzie
totally had the right idea here and she took a little bit of time to
have a look at Morton’s <em>Dark Ecology: Towards a Logic of Future

the first two points and me the third.</p>
<p>After taking some time to read “The Oedipal Logic” essay—we had
already talked through <em>Dark Ecology</em>’s use of Oedipus—MaKenzie
came back somewhat tepid in response to that piece: she found it to have
a bit too much theoretical name-dropping and the treatment of Deleuze
and Guattari’s <em>Capitalism and Schizophrenia</em> volumes seemed to
her to be quite off as well. She joked a little bit: “Can we really
greatly dislike an article and yet still use it?” A fantastic question
that no doubt all scholars—and even budding scholars—ask themselves
constantly. It’s true, the sources that we leaned on really heavily to
write up the first draft were ones that both of us were really positive
about—MaKenzie greatly leveraged the Deleuze on “Crime Novels” to
wonderful effect; she also generated a really fantastic reading of
Jerome Jeffrey Cohen’s short little talk to discuss the ethical
ramifications of not only the Oedipal detective game, but also the way
in which the storm in the novel recalls very Noah-esque parallels; in
“my” section of the article, I found very little to disagree with in our
secondary literature researches (my use of Russell Ford’s “Deleuze’s
Dick” might be a slightly outlier here—but that is due more to the fact
that Ford’s own prey in that essay is far more
philosophical/metaphysical/ontological than the purposes to which I
ultimately put

was in quite a different category here—and MaKenzie sensed it right from
the very start (of course, she did say that there were quite a few spots
in the essay that had some “pullable quotes” for us and our
purposes).<label for="sn-66" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-66" class="margin-toggle"/><span

<p>I told her once more that we were going to have to try to be really
careful here with the Morton. There is no doubt—as MaKenzie also told
me—that there are some really nice nuggets in Morton’s early essay, but
we were clearly going to have to step very gingerly around Morton’s too
simple reading of
psychoanalysis.<label for="sn-65" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-65" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="65" class="sidenote">I do not want to sound wholly negative here on
Morton—I have myself used his work in a very positive manner, see my

<em>Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy</em>, Vol. 33, No. 1 (2017):
48-67.</span> This time around, since we (once again) both felt
similarly about Morton’s early essay—and we both were somewhat on the
“negative” side of the fence, too—we decided to each try our hand at
writing up a couple of paragraphs using Morton’s essay to handle
Dr. Ashman’s feeling that the first section of the essay was still a bit
“undertheorized.” The goal was that we would both try to incorporate the
Morton and whichever of the two of us managed to do so without throwing
the most shade in Morton’s direction, that was the version we would go
with in the next draft. I really liked the way this worked, to be
honest—as it was a slightly different way of writing together that was
moderately different than what we had done for the first draft of the
essay.</p>
<p>MaKenzie’s first stab was really good—as I’ve mentioned an infinite
number of times already, she has this incredibly sharp parsimoniousness
in her writing. She has no problem cutting right to the core of a
thing—and often does so in a way where she would only need five
sentences to do what I might want to do in ten or fifteen. Here was her
initial take:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of the Oedipal detective game is one that was theorized
from a close reading of several contemporary thinkers. Timothy Morton,
in his essay entitled “The Oedipal Logic of Ecological Awareness,””
provides a great starting point for understanding this game that plays
out in the novel. Morton describes the Oedipal logic as being deeply
embedded within agricultural society and allowing for these sort of
contradictory experiences within such a society. Millet propels this
same theory in engaging the children within this detective game: as they
work so hard to conceal their identities and relations, they are only
further revealed; and in the words of Morton, “every being is hobbled
like Oedipus, since every being is marked by the traces of other beings”
(18). The children are caught in this Oedipal contradiction where they
act as both the detectives and the criminals; the detective game acts as
their coping mechanism and distraction from realizing their very real
roles in the climate crisis – roles that may even match the ones their
parents
play.<label for="sn-67" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-67" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="67" class="sidenote">Ibid.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that MaKenzie here was quite strongly working with the extra
words Dr. Ashman passed our way: he gave us an extra five-hundred words
to work with to shore things up. I myself wasn’t really trying at all to
stay within the word
constraints<label for="sn-68" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-68" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="68" class="sidenote">Indeed, my first try was definitely—no
surprise—a bit more long-winded—a copy is available <a
href="5_supporting_materials/a_millet%20essay%20project_materials/drafts/notes_for_shoring_up_the_oedipal_detective_game/kas_shoring_up_the_oedipal_detective_game_in_section_1.pdf">here</a>.</span>—I
felt that the essay would be infinitely strengthened by however many
extra words we had to put in
there.<label for="sn-69" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-69" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="69" class="sidenote">At the time of this writing, we are expecting
to hear back from Dr. Ashman any moment here—if he suggests the
additions need to be trimmed either further, MaKenzie and I will have to
rethink things a bit. My prediction is that our additions will indeed
need to be cut back once again—I would bet that the trimming will
probably be somewhat slight, maybe by a couple hundred words or
so.</span> I thought that MaKenzie’s initial foray was quite good, but
could still benefit from just a little bit more. She had a chance to
look at my first stab; we talked through what I was hoping our additions
would actually end up doing in terms of remedying the
“undertheorization” critique; she showed herself (for the billionth
time) to be such a wonderful writing partner here, saying that I should
feel free to take a shot at building off her initial foundation and that
she trusted me to synthesize together the best parts of both of our
work. Indeed, this is the way the project went right from its inception,
so, again, why bother to “fix something that ain’t broken?” I gave it a
try, producing a couple more versions that built entirely off of
MaKenzie’s first
try.<label for="sn-70" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-70" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="70" class="sidenote">For curious readers, the first version is <a

and the second version is <a

I think these finalized additions are really quite good—I was—broken
record here—quite proud of MaKenzie’s diving directly into the Morton
and getting the ball rolling for us. As should no doubt be crystal-clear
here by now, although the technique here between us was slightly
different from our composing technique in the first draft, our
collaborative focus and intention to constantly work in the space <em>in
between each of us</em> worked wonders for us yet again.</p>
<p>As I say, I was happy with the way we “shored up” the Oedipal
detective game in section 1: the work of Morton does that quite
competently, to my mind. Moreover, I think we managed to quite
dexterously utilize the “Oedipal Logic” essay without getting caught in
Morton’s treatment and use of the psychoanalytic tradition. What made
this a real tightrope-walk kind of situation is no doubt due to a
confluence of different threads that our essay puts forth, but does not
fully trace out as fully as we could if we had had more space. As
previously mentioned, MaKenzie and I didn’t have just one essay here as
the text of the article potentially contains maybe three or four. One of
the major “ghostly” or
“spectral”<label for="sn-71" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-71" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="71" class="sidenote">When I say “ghostly” and “spectral” here I am
riffing on Sarah Ruhl’s wonderful little book, <em>100 Essays I Don’t
Have Time to Write: On Umbrellas and Sword Fights, Parades and Dogs,
Fire Alarms, Children, and Theater</em> (New York: Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, 2015)—in our case here we <em>did</em> write the essay, but the
final product carried along with it a number of “paths not taken” that
we very easily <em>could have taken</em>.</span> essays in here that
doesn’t show up at all in the actual body of the article is a reading of
the novel that is what one might call “strictly psychoanalytic” in
nature. Now, it is absolutely true that we veer infinitely close to
marshalling the psychoanalytic tradition to read this novel—we call the
first half of the book one that is focused on an “<em>Oedipal</em>
detective game,” MaKenzie’s work explicitly cites and uses the work of
Deleuze (certainly not a philosopher how is somehow foreign to
psychoanalytic thinking), and my section leans incredibly heavily on
what one might call a “psychoanalytic deconstruction” of forms of
thinking that owe their existence to Plato and Platonic thought more
generally. I think that one would be more than correct to wonder why
precisely we don’t lean into this incredibly rich vein of philosophical
thinking that comes from the story of Oedipus as itself a foundational
text for Freud and every other psychoanalytic thinker that came after
him.</p>
<p>However, given this admittedly legitimate and fully understandable
surprise on the part of my imagined readers here, I think the line we
took was a perfectly fine one. Morton’s early essay links them
explicitly—it contains treatments not only of <em>Oedipus</em> as one of
the very first “crime novels,” one could say (Morton is right to say
this, as both MaKenzie and I—and Deleuze as well, for that
matter—agree). Still, it was important for us to toe this line very,
very, very carefully. I think my (I should say “our” here, of course)
worry and concern that if we didn’t treat Morton very gingerly with our
additions, we would quite directly open up this entire “psychoanalytic
can of worms.” Additionally, given the scope of Dr. Ashman’s
collection—it is about, after all, <em>crime fiction and ecology</em>—it
seemed prudent of us to pick off and utilize just the Oedipus-ecology
strand in Morton’s essay. This also seemed fine to me too as MaKenzie’s
brilliant use of Deleuze’s essay would give us as much of the whole
crime novel/metaphysics of truth conjunction that we wanted to bring out
so strongly. Indeed, I think that our essay does manage to not only walk
this line carefully, it also opens up a number of different territories
that we think may result in fertile grounds for future scholars of crime
fiction and also of Millet’s novel, too. Deleuze’s essay, it seems to
me, has not been fully utilized—it certainly hasn’t been strongly used
within the secondary literature on Deleuze, Ford’s essay here is the
only one that comes immediately to mind here. Thus, we both think that
we have opened up realms not only for crime fiction scholars, but also
regions that Deleuzians might want to play within also. I do also think
that if MaKenzie and I wanted to go back to this well once again in
another article, we could easily do that—so many things would already be
in place and such a writing project would be incredibly smooth for us,
without a doubt.</p>

Laying Out Some More Context for the “Oedipal Detective Game”
Itself</h6>
<p>Handling this second criticism was actually quite simple and
straightforward. MaKenzie jumped at the chance to handle this all
herself. I—as has been so often the case for me throughout all the time
working one-on-one and side-by-side with her—affirmed this feeling and
told her to go full throttle. She had—long before this point in
time—shown herself to be so competent in all of this, I had no
reservations whatsoever. That turned out to be the perfect way to go:
MaKenzie’s additions greatly fleshed-out some of the parameters of the
game that not only greatly clarified the game itself, but also (again!)
gave me some ammunition when it came to thinking about how to tackle the
third and final concern Dr. Ashman had for our initial draft.</p>
<h6

Tying Up Some Loose Ends in the “Resolution” Section of the Essay</h6>
<p>This third area for revision asked us to think just a bit more about
the whole “detection” side of the “detective novel” or “crime fiction”
genre within which we are intervening here. Dr. Ashman suggested an
introductory essay from <em>Green
Letters</em><label for="sn-73" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-73" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="73" class="sidenote">Jo Lindsay Walton and Samantha Walton,
“Introduction to <em>Green Letters: Crime Fiction and Ecology</em>.”
<em>Green Letters</em> 22:1 (2018), pp. 2-6.</span> might be something
to have a look at. It turns out that this journal issue was one that I
had already had a read of way back in the summer before as MaKenzie and
I were just doing some general background reading (we went in its
direction largely because Dr. Ashman had an article of his own in that
issue<label for="sn-74" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-74" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="74" class="sidenote">Nathan Ashman, “Hard-boiled Ecologies: Ross

(2018), pp. 43-54. More information on this work is available and
indexed <a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14688417.2018.1431139">here</a>.</span>).
At the time I read it, I wasn’t quite sure at all if it was germane for
our purposes—Dr. Ashman’s article was helpful, however—we didn’t use it,
but it did give us a really good “lay of the land,” so to speak. Back in
the summer, the Waltons’ essay didn’t strike me as all that helpful.
However, after returning to the Morton work, it came into focus much
more clearly how this short introduction might become more functional
for us. Morton’s <em>Dark Ecology</em> makes the case that there is
indeed a connection between the tale of Oedipus, the ever-worsening
climate crisis, and the genre of crime fiction. Morton writes there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a responsible member of this species [humanity] for the
Anthropocene. Of course I am formally responsible to the extent that I
understand global warming. That’s all you need to be responsible for
something. You understand that this truck is going to hit that man? You
are responsible for that man. Yet in this case formal responsibility is
strongly reinforced by causal responsibility. I am the criminal. And I
discover this via scientific forensics. Just like in noir fiction: I’m
the detective and the criminal! I’m a person. I’m also part of an entity
that is now a <em>geophysical force on a planetary
scale.</em><label for="sn-76" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-76" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="76" class="sidenote">Morton, <em>Dark Ecology</em>,
pp. 8-9.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introductory essay by the Waltons also takes up this Morton tack,
quite explicitly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As climate science and escalating climate catastrophe reveal the
complex material interrelatedness that cuts across familiar categories
of the economic and environmental, cultural and natural, individual and
collective, local and global, ecological detectives may be called upon
to bear witness, diagnose, organise, protest, persuade, suffer, mourn,
and act. The premise of separation and transcendence of the social
field, on which the nineteenth century detective was partly based, may
also prove incongruous. As Timothy Morton suggests, the perspective of
the noir detective takes on new significance in an era in which
ecological entanglement can no longer be ignored: ‘The noir narrator
begins investigating a supposedly external situation, from a supposedly
neutral point of view, only to discover that she or he is implicated in
it’ (Morton 2010, pp. 16–17). Understanding our ecological enmeshment
shifts emphasis to the detective as a situated and imperfectly
knowledgeable agent who must act
nevertheless.<label for="sn-77" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-77" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="77" class="sidenote">Walton and Walton, p. 3.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having canvassed the Morton essay—and then returning to reread the
Waltons’ introduction—it struck us quite strongly that there may be a
little too quick conflation of the tools of reason and rationality (the
tools utilized by climatology and climate scientists) and the figure of
the “noir detective.” MaKenzie’s leveraging of Deleuze’s essay gave us a
slightly tweaked angle of perspective on this. For Deleuze—as MaKenzie’s
section of our makes abundantly clear—it is important to separate a
detective’s utilization of these tools of reason and rationality—and
either inductive or deductive logic—(which he says is a staple of the
“classical detective
genre”)<label for="sn-78" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-78" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="78" class="sidenote">Once more, it’s time to give credit where
credit is due: my thinking on this whole issue was greatly enhanced by
numerous conversations with my other most brilliant student ever,
William D. Mastin, who talked through Deleuze’s theoretical position on
this genre more times than I could ever count. All the progression on
this front in my thinking is due to him.</span> and the noir detective’s
almost complete and total lack of these methodologies. As Deleuze
formulates it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the new literary use and exploitation of cops and criminals
taught us is that police activity has nothing to do with a metaphysical
or scientific search for the truth. Police work no more resembles
scientific inquiry than a telephone call from an informant, inter-police
relations, or mechanisms of torture resemble metaphysics.* As a general
rule, there are two distinct cases: 1) the professional murder, where
the police know immediately more or less who is responsible; and 2) the
sexual murder, where the guilty party could be anyone. <em>But in either
case the problem is not framed in terms of truth. It is rather an
astonishing compensation of error.</em> The suspect, known to the cops
but never charged, is either nabbed in some other domain than his usual
sphere of criminal activity (whence the American schema of the
untouchable gangster, who is arrested and deported for tax fraud); or he
is provoked, forced to show himself, as they lie in wait for
him.<label for="sn-79" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-79" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="79" class="sidenote">Deleuze, “Philosophy of Crime Fiction,” <br />
pp. 82-3, emphasis mine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I say, both MaKenzie and I zeroed-in—rather independently—on this
too quick conflation: the noir detective, in Deleuze’s eyes, <em>does
not</em> have recourse to rationality in his search for the criminal.
This is—perhaps, again—another spot in our revised second draft where we
skirt a little too close to opening up yet another gigantic can of
worms. There is no doubt that the overall thrust of Morton and the
Waltons’ argument strike us as <em>prima facie</em> correct, but
Deleuze’s split in the genre—between the “classical” and “noir
detective” genre asks one to revise their thinking just slightly. The
real connection here between the scientific detective who detects
climate change and the “noir detective” has more to do with the
detective’s own culpability as an accessory in climate crimes than it
does with the methodology by which said detective comes to her
discoveries. Long story short, Dr. Ashman’s suggestion that we have a
look at this introduction to <em>Green Letters</em> was indeed helpful
as it allowed us to sharpen our own intervention here even more: the
secondary literature here argues that the qualities of Oedipus as
detective is to be likened best to the noir detective (Morton’s argument
in a simple nutshell), whereas we are arguing that Deleuze’s essay
suggests scholar err on the side of caution here just a bit more.</p>
<p>I can imagine an argument that says our tiny edits to this third
section do not really handle the third point of critique—the recourse to
Morton and the Waltons does end up in section one (which is where it
should go, of course)—and that the tiny little ligaments we added to the
final section do not fully address the concern. That said, I think the
way we handled it is quite sufficiently for our purposes. We had a goal
of figuring out how to properly theorize the “Oedipal detective game” in
section one and we both feel that, overall and in general, the additions
greatly strengthen the essay as a whole. I think we managed to
incorporate Morton’s theorizations without falling into either the
Scylla of Morton’s treatment of psychoanalysis or the Charybdis of
getting bogged down in too much (perhaps unnecessary) exploration of the
massive secondary literature on crime fiction more broadly. Again, as I
said, this was indeed an incredibly difficult tightrope to walk—but I
think the final product does it quite competently. I should also say
that, once again, MaKenzie and I learned how to do something else
together that we had yet to try out in the composition of the article,
namely, how to think through and handle revisions of our work. I am
incredibly proud of MaKenzie and how well she handled it. Again, given
our shared baseline feelings about revision work in general, I think we
both figured out how to do this quite, quite well.</p>
<h4 id="learning-new-things-and-incorporating-the-old">1.1.5.3 Learning
New Things and Incorporating the Old</h4>
<p>I think one of the other things about this whole project that was so
wonderful and beautiful was how both of us had to learn so many things
in order to write this essay. “Crime fiction” isn’t in my area of
expertise (far from it, in fact); the ecological/environmental
philosophy angle is in my wheel house, so to speak; contemporary fiction
is also nowhere close to my home base. But there’s no doubt the two of
us had to learn and read together in order to acquire all that we
needed—I definitely did not somehow “have all the knowledge” ahead of
time. I had to grow, add a bunch of new things to my repertoire.
MaKenzie did too—and, again, we did it together, at the same time. Of
course, it would hardly be true to say that I hadn’t read more than
MaKenzie. But she has spoken to me so passionately and strongly of how
impactful my presence in her educational journey has been. I know I’ve
mentioned it before, but when she writes that “[w]hat was (and still
is!) always so wonderful about our conversations is that I never feel
like Spicer is talking down to me; and the moments where I taught him
something or pointed out something he hadn’t seen are incredibly
genuine”—this is not to be forgotten. I never “talked down to her”
because that would have installed an imbalance between the two of us
that I never could have stomached—first and foremost because it would
greatly sabotage all the work we were trying to do together.</p>
<p>I think the best way to describe this is with something a little
metaphorical. I am trying really hard not to toot my own horn here, but
I think that what really separates good teachers from great teachers is
not so much their willingness to “learn new things,” although that is an
absolute prerequisite for great teachers too. I think that what great
teachers do is show a profound willingness to walk back over the ground
they have traveled, walk back over that ground back to where their
student currently stands—and to then re-travel and re-traverse that very
same road, side-by-side with their student, every step of the way. Being
able to retrace one’s steps as if the path those steps tread upon was
brand new (and it will be, if one travels alongside their student, as
the teacher will be able to see and re-experience through the eyes of
their student, places and paths that they thought they already knew but
can see now in a new and different way). Bad teachers refuse to travel
back towards their students—perhaps simply sitting ahead of them, always
waiting for the latter to catch-up. Nothing good comes of such a
pedagogy. We have to travel back to our student, no matter how many
times we’ve already walked that path and no matter how much farther
along it we’ve been able to move. The only kind of real learning that
happens is when teacher and student walk the path <em>together</em>.
Heidegger has some remarks in an essay on Nietzsche where he writes of
something similar with regards to philosophy and thinkers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before sowing comes plowing. It is essential to reclaim the field
that had to remain in obscurity while the land of metaphysics was
inescapably dominant. It is essential first of all to sense, to intuit,
this field; then to find it; and then to cultivate it. It is essential
to go out to this field for the first time. Many are the paths still
unknown. Yet each thinker is allotted only one way, his own, in the
tracks of which he must go back and forth, time and again, in order at
last to keep to it as his own, though it is never his, and say what he
came to know on this one
path.<label for="sn-112" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-112" class="margin-toggle"/><span

Dead’” <br /> in <em>Off the Beaten Track</em>, ed. and trans. Julian Young <br /> and
Kenneth Haynes (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002), <br /> p. 158.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“[E]ach thinker is allotted only one way … though it is never his”—if
we tweak this just slightly, we can say a good teacher is one who is
willing to “go back and forth” along a path and to be willing to know
that the path traveled “is never his.” The teacher does indeed travel a
path they have “known,” to some degree, in some sense, but the path is
not his—and nothing shows him this more strongly than when that teacher
retreads old paths to move back towards his student, all with the goal
of returning back down that same path, right beside her.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have learned all the new things—nor could I have seen so
many of the old things in a brand new light—if I hadn’t had MaKenzie
alongside me, always giving me ample opportunities to see things through
her eyes. An experience like this—yes, broken record—is so rare and the
chance to do it is one I will never, ever take for granted.</p>
<h4 id="charting-new-territory">1.1.5.4 Charting New Territory</h4>
<p>I think that one of the most impressive things—and there are so many
impressive things that helped contribute to the success of this
project—is that not only did MaKenzie and I both have to learn new
things, but that we actually took these new things and used them to
produce something that, to my mind, strikes out into brand-new
territory. In the “Senior Capstone Presentation” that MaKenzie held with
the other English faculty in Finals Week this last December, Dr. Ioanes
mentioned this herself, asking MaKenzie what it was like to step into a
space that had not been mapped out yet entirely, or at all; Dr. Ioanes
was generous in her praise and found our work incredibly good precisely
because it stepped to space yet to be fully investigated by all kinds of
practicing scholars. During the presentation, MaKenzie was lavish with
her praise of me for helping her not to be too terribly apprehensive
about this. Moreover, in her reflection she writes: “With this being my
first dive into the world of truly scholarly writing, I needed a lot of
guidance throughout the entire process. Luckily, Spicer was there to
shape my ideas and goals for this paper into something that resembled a
truly professional piece of
writing.”<label for="sn-114" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-114" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="114" class="sidenote">Munson, “Reflection,” p. 6.</span> I am not
really sure how much guidance MaKenzie needed with all of this—to be
perfectly honest—she entered this space like a fish to water.</p>
<p>No doubt what makes MaKenzie’s work so frighteningly exceptional is
the way she felt no fear jumping into new waters with this paper. There
isn’t a ton of work like this essay out there—and goodness knows that
even the secondary literature on Millet’s novel is hardly plentiful.
This is not even to mention the fact that scholars working on such a
peculiar intersection of interests as “crime fiction <em>and</em>
ecology” are very few and very far between. It’s not a huge
community/field and the fact that we were able to plant our feet
somewhere here still surprises me enormously when I look back on it. I
also would like to say that MaKenzie’s first dive matches up so nicely
and effortlessly with the kind of person she is: one in a bazillion, as
I’ve no doubt said already way too much.</p>
<h3 id="concluding-remarks-on-makenzies-trajectory">1.1.6 Concluding
Remarks on MaKenzie’s Trajectory</h3>
<p>It will no doubt be totally unnecessary, but I would like to say here
how proud I am of MaKenzie—not just with regards to all the work we did
writing together, but to all of the wonderful work she did in all of the
courses she worked so hard on over the entire Fall 2022 semester. There
is no uncertainty in saying that she pushed herself quite a lot this
last Fall semester. It makes me smile so much here now to think of how
in previous semesters she had (I think) to struggle quite a bit to get
motivated about so many things—and, as she knows, I have told her often
how proud I was of her for doing that in those semesters; more often
than not, it was really hard for her: it’s true, she so often had to
really work to get up for so much that I’m not quite sure she was really
all that interested in chasing at the end of the day. I think the kind
of pushing and hard work she put in during this final semester was so
much more enjoyable and, hopefully, it has been something that she has
not found to be just horrible drudgery. I’ll bet she’d say too that she
pushed hard this semester, but it was a good kind of pushing as we were
chasing those “unofficial interests” of hers. As I’ve already mentioned,
I rarely had a day when I didn’t keep those “unofficial interests” in
the very forefront of my mind.</p>
<p>Right from the very start—maybe even from before the two of us ever
met—, I wanted her and her education to be the very best that I have
ever helped to give a student—ever. This next part will no doubt sound
incredibly pompous (and it does indeed bump up against my humility a
lot). As I said in my “Reflection” on our work together, our closeness
made it super-easy for me to know with pretty much absolute certainty
that I could be the greatest teacher, mentor, advisor, writing partner,
that she could ever have wanted. As she and I grew and grew ever closer
with each passing day we spent thinking, talking, and reading together,
I became more and more certain that I could very well be what I thought
she needed from a
mentor.<label for="sn-81" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-81" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="81" class="sidenote">See the “Concluding Remarks” section of my
“Reflection” pp. 18-22, especially, for more discussion on this
front.</span> I think that many will say there’s little doubt whatsoever
that that was true in her case and for her—and I am not at all skeptical
about this anymore simply because MaKenzie herself has said that this
was true. Before we ultimately decided that she should take a highly
expedited path towards graduation, we would often joke about her perhaps
sticking around long enough to win all of the (academic and nonacademic)
awards that she no doubt would have won. She was always adamant that she
never wanted any of those awards and accolades and that my pride in her
was all she ever wanted. I can’t even begin to fully communicate how
much pride and joy I have in her and her work and her accomplishments. I
cannot—and will not—hog any of the credit for that. None of the kudos
for any of that goes to me—all of it goes to MaKenzie and her alone. I
have been so fortunate to have watched her come <em>so far</em> and done
so much in an insanely short amount of time. MaKenzie mentioned in her
“Reflection” the way in which I always, <em>always</em>, saw things in
her that she may not have fully seen in
herself.<label for="sn-82" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-82" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="82" class="sidenote">Munson, “Reflection,” p. 8—her “Final Words”
section is incredibly germane in this context.</span> I can’t even say
how true I think that is. If I’ve done anything at all to help MaKenzie
and her growth and development—there are no other accomplishments and
accolades I could ever want besides her own pride in me for doing so;
there’s nothing else anyone could ever want more.</p>
<p>Students like MaKenzie just don’t ever come around—and I am so
fortunate that we crossed paths. She has said numerous times, as she did
in her “Reflection,”” that she has had an absolutely identical feeling:
“As I’ve told him before, I am so lucky that I found someone at USF like
him. I think my college experience would have been bland and
monochromatic if not for the two of us
connecting.”<label for="sn-80" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-80" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="80" class="sidenote">Munson, “Reflection,” p. 8.</span> I have been
teaching for what now feels to me to be a very, very long time—somewhat
close to twenty years if you count my time in graduate school. I have
never met anyone quite like MaKenzie before. To say she was an
intellectual superstar that was one in a million is a horrifyingly gross
understatement. I cannot even really begin to say how absolutely
singular and unique MaKenzie is, when all is said and done—and every
single day/session we had chatting was a complete and total joy. She
has, again, herself written similar things (I hope readers will forgive
me for length of this long citation—but it says so much of what I myself
want to say about my pedagogy while also providing a bit more context
for some remarks that I have already excised out—and, even better,
MaKenzie says it in a way that is infinitely better than I ever
could):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it also goes without saying (but I’ll say it anyway) that I
am incredibly grateful for Dr. Spicer and all his wisdom, guidance, and
support throughout my past 2.5 years as a student at USF. He sees so
much in me that I fail to see in myself and pushes me to have confidence
in myself and my capabilities. Working together has hardly ever felt
like work at all and I think we share in the sentiment that we will miss
our Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays spent in his office thinking
through any number of things each time. Spicer has a skillful way of
finding something in even my most off-topic tangents, even spinning
philosophical revelations from TikToks videos I found interesting. None
of our time together was ever wasted, in every sense of the word – we
could always generate something from incredibly minute topics and we
always had fun doing it. This level of entertainment and enjoyment in
productivity seems so rare. What I am most grateful for from Spicer is
that I always know that he is someone I can go to. He has helped me
through countless personal difficulties and has given me advice ranging
from how to quit an incredibly toxic and draining job to reaching for
opportunities I would have never thought to be possible. As I’ve told
him before, I am so lucky that I found someone at USF like him. I think
my college experience would have been bland and monochromatic if not for
the two of us
connecting.<label for="sn-83" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-83" class="margin-toggle"/><span

</blockquote>
<p>I think it completely and totally true to affirm MaKenzie’s comment
here that “[w]orking together has hardly ever felt like work at all” and
that “none of our time together was ever wasted.” It is hard to describe
how much fun, invigorating, and truly inspiring this entire “Millet
project” endeavor was for both of us. Teachers pray desperately and
often to come across a student like MaKenzie—and the odds of a teacher
ever finding one like her has so often felt to me to be like close to
zero. I would like to say that I knew from the very beginning—even from
“before the beginning”—how lucky and fortunate I was to connect up with
her and I tried to never have a day when I took that for granted. It has
truly been a once in a lifetime experience for me as a teacher and a
scholar—and I wouldn’t be willing to trade it for anything else in the
world.</p>
<h2
id="mathematics-literature-and-philosophy-with-william-d.-mastin-23">1.2
Mathematics, Literature, and Philosophy with William D. Mastin
(’23)</h2>
<p>Back in Section 0, I mentioned another student that I would meet very
soon after crossing paths with MaKenzie, William D. Mastin. MaKenzie
will always be incredibly special to me and she will always be without a
peer in my book. That said, William comes a very, very close second to
MaKenzie. It’s silly to rank those we deeply love and care for—and the
fact that William is only nanometers behind MaKenzie is no lack or
deficiency on his part (more than anything it probably has more to do
with the fact that I have known MaKenzie for a slightly longer period of
time). Since I found myself living a profound charmed life in the Fall
of 2021 (having, at that time, now met my two favorite students I’ve
ever had the honor of being able to call “my students” and to call
myself “their teacher”), it’s shocking to me the luck of all this. I
would like to talk here about the work done with William—and if it does
not come to same length of material that MaKenzie gets in this
reflection, I would still like to tell a bit of my story with William
here now.</p>
<h3
id="covering-old-paths-and-returning-anew-to-old-scholarly-stomping-grounds-of-mine">1.2.1
Covering Old Paths and Returning (Anew) to Old Scholarly Stomping
Grounds of Mine</h3>
<p>I greatly hope that this exercise will make something else quite
clear. In so many ways, one could say that all exceptionally bright
students, all exorbitantly stellar and brilliant students—all these
adjectives fit both of them to a T—are, at the end of the day, all
pretty much quite the same. I think that there is some tiny iota of
truth to this—no doubt readers will find me naming (probably both
consciously and unconsciously) all kinds of uncanny similarities between
the two of them—but I have found that these two (although they are
maddeningly similar in so many different ways) are each radically and
singular and unique in ways that are idiosyncratic to each of them. I
hope that the narrative here is able to speak to how I tried to speak
very directly and very uniquely to each of these two, always putting
them and their singularities first, and never, ever treating them as if
they and their intellectual journeys were somehow easily substitutable
for each other in some banal way. With MaKenzie this process was quite
easy—she and I are, I think, temperamentally and intellectually
identical to one another. William, although very similar intellectually,
has an entirely different temperament, and good teaching on my part was
going to need to be incredibly attentive to that difference.</p>
<p>Very similarly to how it went with MaKenzie, I recall the very first
e-mail William ever sent my way (and I’ll never, ever forget either of
the first e-mails these two sent to me). He introduced himself to me
saying that we had never met before, “but [he] had heard great things
about [my]
courses.”<label for="sn-115" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-115" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="115" class="sidenote">William D. Mastin, personal communication,
August 10, 2021.</span> If MaKenzie absolutely exploded into my world
with a beautifully reckless boldness (so typical of her), then William
came my way in a somewhat more cautious, reserved, understated, and
almost “quiet” way (which is also one of his most beautiful personality
traits). He wrote in that initial e-mail: “In the last eighteen months,
I’ve been drawn increasingly to literature and have begun to read the
western literary canon; I have come across the idea that one of the many
purposes of fiction, and perhaps of art in general, is to relate truths
that nonfiction cannot reach – this has been a great motivation for my
study of
literature.”<label for="sn-116" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-116" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="116" class="sidenote">Ibid.</span> William thus came to me with a
project, with a very specific goal in mind: “In my as yet limited
readings, I’ve quickly found that the amount of study I am able to
exercise on works of fiction is quite limited. Not entirely nonexistent,
but certainly in need of radical development should I be able to succeed
in my project: to uncover and understand the truths that I believe are
present in and essential to great
literature.”<label for="sn-117" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-117" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="117" class="sidenote">Ibid.</span> Again, in beautiful contrast with
MaKenzie’s fearless adventurousness, William was more conservative (even
though his project was so far from “conservative” it’s not even
funny):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if you might be open to a correspondence discussing
techniques of literary analysis, comprehension, and interpretation. I’m
sure that you, being quite a popular professor at USF, have little time
for extraneous activities, so I hope that what I ask will not seem
arrogant or onerous; if this will be a tax on your time, I beg you not
to feel obliged to participate. If, however, you are willing and able to
participate, I’m sure that it would be a great help and service to me,
and I would be greatly indebted to
you.<label for="sn-118" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-118" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="118" class="sidenote">Ibid.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back at this initial message, a couple of things jump out at
me immediately. First—and, once again, I’m trying be humble here—, it
would seem that my reputation preceded me here quite a bit when William
describes me as a “popular professor.” Second, it still surprises me
(even after all these years) when students seem shocked (as I think
William probably was when we first met) that I have anything better to
do than to spend time with them; I am also myself quite amazed now upon
rereading how William describes our potential collaboration as something
that might be “extraneous.” The past two years reading and working with
William has never felt extraneous—it was, in fact, the exact opposite as
our work became more and more necessary for me each and every day we
talked. That said, this starting e-mail is a good indicator of William
and how he rolls: cautious yet terrifyingly rigorous. My readers won’t
be surprised, but, again, as I did with MaKenzie, I leapt at the chance
this totally-unknown-student-to-me was offering
here.<label for="sn-119" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-119" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="119" class="sidenote">William has himself written copiously
and—again, similarly to MaKenzie—beautifully of our relationship. I have

admission to graduation school <a

I am going to try my best to cover some of the same ground that he does,
but from my own perspective on the journey; he himself narrates the
“student” side of this student/mentor relation wonderfully, while I’ll
cover the latter side myself here. All further citations from this essay
will occur parenthetically in the main body of my reflection.</span></p>
<p>Very similarly to MaKenzie, William has written quite a lot about his
time with me—and this fact has made documenting my own journey with them
here incredibly easy. William’s major narrative occurs in a very lengthy
cover letter he composed for admission to graduate school in
philosophy—and, just as I did with MaKenzie’s own “Reflection,” I will
citing William’s essay copiously and often. As William tries to
articulate in this cover letter, he came my way, sought me out, with
questions, and an ever-increasing list of problems with all kinds of
answers that he found insufficient, paltry—he crossed my path carrying a
really profound degree of dissatisfaction; he found me in the hopes that
I might help him somehow with all these incredibly sophisticated
philosophical and ontological questions about aesthetics, the nature of
truth, mathematics, fiction and literature, and so much more. William
was hungry—it was often scary to me during our early days together how
hungry he actually was—even after we had spent hours talking about
philosophy, the rapacious appetite never struck me as sated. (This is no
doubt one of the most glaringly evident similarities between MaKenzie
and William—both of them were so hungry, hungry for knowledge, hungry
for an intellectual partner that could hold their own with them—this
hunger is absolutely beautiful, but can no doubt be quite off-putting to
many. The desires of others often shock us more than we would like to
admit—always hoping that the other person has desires and hungers just
like our own definitely makes us feel comfortable, but it’s probably an
illusory
comfort.<label for="sn-155" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-155" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="155" class="sidenote">These remarks here are wholly influenced by
Lacan and his brand of psychoanalysis, which teaches that there is
always something (potentially) unsettling about the desire of another
person—and it probably goes without saying that this can also be true of
the other person’s profound gratitude—the way the other person talks
about how important we have been to/for them can produce a great deal of
turbulence for us. We never quite know—fully—exactly what we are to and
for the other. The question posed to the other, “What am I to you?” can
bring us up against a profound opaqueness and opacity. Of course, the
other can always try to answer this question, but we can always wonder
if that answer really and truly cuts to the heart of the matter. In the
realm of pedagogy, this fundamental riddle of the other has arisen with
both of the students I have talked about so much here. They have told me
often and very directly how profoundly impactful I have been on them and
their lives. (I’ve already recounted these kinds of sentiments countless
times here.) However, one cannot help but wonder to themselves, “But
c’mon—I can’t really have been <em>that</em> influential, been
<em>that</em> significant, been <em>that</em> life-changing and
-altering …” Despite how often I have told them that it cannot be true
that I was ever that effective in drastically changing their lives for
the good, they have told me infinitely more times: “Hey buddy, you need
to let that shit go”—as MaKenzie loves to respond when I say it to
her—because neither of them will let me shortchange or lessen or
diminish how much I changed them for the better.</span> All of this
didn’t bother me in the slightest—I knew long before they probably did
how we would use this fuel to do more and more and more: to grow closer
as friends and conversational partners, to help me speed-up and
intensify their intellectual growth, to make it so my mentorship of them
could become something that I hoped they would never look back on with
anything but a smile. Thinking about this now, I know this worked out
perfectly for both of them, as they have each said as much to me more
times than I could ever even count.)</p>
<p>So what was this mentoring relationship like early on in the Fall of
2021? If the rapport and understanding with MaKenzie was seemingly
instantaneous, William and I had to do a little bit more work before
coming to some kind of awareness and agreement about how we wanted to
learn, read, talk, and think together. Because William came with already
incredibly deep ontological, epistemological, and philosophical
questions, the tactic one needed to engage him couldn’t be the same one
used with MaKenzie. MaKenzie’s mind is—as I’ve already shown, I’m
sure—too much like mine: obsessional in the best sense, always leaping
from one idea, one book, one philosophy to another—always jumping and
leaping away to other matters from the one on the agenda; William’s mind
does not quite work this way, his is more like a steel trap, as the old
proverbial cliché goes. He will latch onto an idea and won’t relinquish
it for days, weeks, months even. As I say, although these two students
are so similar to one another, there was no one size fits all solution
for the pair of them. One would have to switch things up a bit. Still,
it’s certainly true that in both of their cases it was clear to me from
the start what they wanted, what I thought they needed. With that in
mind, different pedagogical solutions began to easily present
themselves.</p>
<p>This wanting to treat each and every student according to their own
singular uniqueness was not lost on William—no two students are the same
and our relations to them, therefore, cannot be identical either.
William narrates in his cover letter the very first time we ever met and
ever chatted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a perfect August afternoon, and the campus was in full bloom.
We sat on one of the benches lining the path that winds through the
quad, connecting the old and new areas of the campus. We began to speak.
I can remembering noticing immediately just how easily I could speak to
this man, and what an odd experience that was! I hadn’t spoken to anyone
about any serious topic in over 18 months, and yet the words seemed to
literally slide off my tongue and hover in front of me for the smallest
moment, before Dr. Spicer would take hold of them, turn them in his
hands, pull his own from his pocket, and toss the new thought back
towards me. It was, quite literally, a divine experience. (4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I have no idea whatsoever why I so often seem to have
this kind of effect on students—the ease with which they like to speak
to me, I have no idea why this is so often the case (uncountable numbers
of students have said this to me before in the past and both MaKenzie
and William have relayed this sentiment to me way too many times to ever
keep track
of).<label for="sn-120" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-120" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="120" class="sidenote">The best explanation for what might be going
on here comes from the Lacanian psychoanalytic camp. Kirsten Hyldgaard’s
“The Discourse of Education—the Discourse of the Slave,” <em>Educational
Philosophy and Theory</em>, Vol. 38, No. 2 (2006), pp. 145-158 is
absolutely brilliant and strikes me as the <em>sine qua non</em> in this
arena—not only that, but I think this essay is completely and totally
right in highlighting the importance of “transference” in pedagogy and
teaching.</span> I should confess, however, that perhaps it need not be
so mysterious, as William goes on to highlight what it was that I gave
to him on our very first conversation (again, my apologies for the
length of these quotations):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We spoke for three hours that day, from noon until three. Our
conversation swam from personal history to literature to philosophy
(nothing serious at first, I must mention), and back again at a
galloping pace, while I attempted, with a grin splitting my face, to
hold on. Our conversation was so distinctly different from those I had
observed in the political and “publicly intellectual” spaces, that I
found myself quite at a loss for exactly what to say; I had no idea how
to operate in this space. Even so, the words kept tumbling out,
apparently not of my own accord. At the time, I would have thought this
to be something akin to a moral sin which, after lurking for some time,
would come up from the deep and snatch me back down out of my arrogance.
So much more surprised was I, then, when Dr. Spicer did not sneer or
scoff or simply get up and leave, but listened to my juvenile ramblings
and considered them somewhat seriously! Such an experience I had never
had, and such a man I had never met. His mind was absolutely immense. I
have often said, when holding in my hands a book like Kant’s first
<em>Critique</em> or Heidegger’s <em>Being and Time</em>, that it feels
as if I hold a black hole in my hands. Sitting next to Kevin Spicer on
that bench on that August afternoon, it was as if I sat next to Atlas
himself. I hated to leave, but our conversation had exhausted my mind to
the point of incoherence. We said goodbye, and I walked away, in shock
of the man I had discovered by sheer luck and chance. (4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would beg my readers here to note very carefully and closely what
William writes here: “So much more surprised was I, then, when
Dr. Spicer did not sneer or scoff or simply get up and leave, but
listened to my juvenile ramblings and considered them somewhat
seriously! Such an experience I had never had, and such a man I had
never met.” I find William’s quintessential cautiousness rearing it’s
head here: “… and considered them somewhat seriously!” That “somewhat”
there strikes me as wholly unnecessary—I didn’t then (and never have
since) ever “<em>somewhat</em> seriously” consider the things William
has said to me in any of our philosophical conversations.</p>
<p>Before continuing on here, I would like to venture a tiny aside here:
why are students so surprised, so shocked, when we listen to the things
they say and consider them with a great deal of seriousness? I’ve
already cited the paragraphs where MaKenzie wrote something almost
identical: that I always took what she—and William—said to me with a
great deal of seriousness and interest. At the point in time William is
narrating here, he didn’t know me at all; I would guess that if you
asked him now, after two years of study together, if he could ever even
imagine me “sneering” or “scoffing” at one of his thoughts, he would say
such a thing would be absolutely impossible to imagine—and he would be
right. It breaks my heart to think of these two brilliant students
coming across teachers in their past who didn’t listen to them … and I
know they had teachers like this, as they’ve told me those stories so
many times. Are the teachers who are “unwilling to travel back towards
their student,” as I talked about in Section 1.1.5.4 <em>supra</em>,
ones that would scoff and sneer at a student’s thoughts? I know what I
think the answer to that question is, but, again, I note a very common
similarity between MaKenzie and William when the latter mentions more
than once in his cover letter the way in which I tried to work with him
as he studied things that I myself had already investigated in some way,
shape, or form. Here he is on page 6 noting how we eventually made our
way to psychoanalysis: “… I was more than happy to make a fine study of
the area with my good friend guiding me all the
way.”<label for="sn-121" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-121" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="121" class="sidenote">See page 5 where, after telling the story of
some of the first forays out of his Platonic/neo-Platonic worldview and
into that of the sophists: “After hiding inside for so long, I found the
wind pleasant on my face. Strong the new wind was, and violent, but I
found a wonderful guide by my side, helping me to sway and dance in the
gale.”</span> Here he is on the turn to Heidegger’s work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite never having read many of the texts we spoke of, I was
nevertheless able to speak about them without a problem, thanks to
Dr. Spicer’s inimitable ability to summarize a complex topic in a few
sentences, with the kind of richness and depth that only comes from the
most profound contemplation. This has been an invaluable gift; it has
made extremely difficult texts incredibly understandable to me on a
first reading. This has allowed our conversations to extend far beyond
my measly repertoire. My exposure to Heidegger followed this model; in
reading <em>On the Way to Language</em>, though still shocked and
paralyzed by the profundity of the work, I found it to be intelligible
and even understandable. All thanks to my dearest friend and mentor.
(7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here he is canvassing our move towards Shakespeare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had, throughout our friendship, danced around Shakespeare.
Dr. Spicer is a fine Shakespearean, and so was quite anxious to
introduce me to the bard ever since he noted the spark of potential in
me. Under a mutual, though unspoken concurrence that it was, finally,
the right time to study the plays and poems, we agreed to devote the
summer and following fall term to Shakespeare. We began in June with
<em>Julius Caesar</em>. It was certainly pastures new for me, and for my
mentor as well, in an odd way. It was a different newness for each one
of us, which allowed a wonderful and fascinating <em>pas de deux</em> of
study. I would bring up quite a naive point (I’ll still call them such,
though Dr. Spicer insists they were not) and Dr. Spicer would turn it in
such a way that made it seem more profound a question than I ever could
have conjured on my own; this is the value of years of devoted study.
This capacity of Spicer’s, which continued all through our studies, even
past the point where I ceased to ask naive questions, was absolutely
invaluable. I can say with a fine degree of certainty that (it would be
tedious of me to remind the reader to give every medal to my mentor, so
I won’t) I was able to make as complete and profound a study of
Shakespeare as any undergraduate could hope to make. (8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William knows me all too well—even today, long after his application
for graduate school has been submitted—, I never found his queries and
points to be “naive,” far from it. Again, I do not at all understand why
students like William and MaKenzie had to have teachers who <em>didn’t
take</em> their ideas and try to make something of them, to make
something <em>with</em> them (I love the multiplicity in this “with”
here: not only make something with their ideas, but also to make
something with them too). It boggles the mind and I have yet to be able
to wrap my mind around it. Both of them have astronomically limitless
intellectual potential; it’s not clear to me at all why they seem to
have had no one actually see it in them prior to their meeting me.</p>
<p>Is it really that simple, though—that the main pedagogical technique
here was just to <em>listen to what William said</em> and to help him
work his questions and queries into something a little sharper, perhaps
a little bit more sophisticated, maybe even a tiny bit better
formulated? He will say it was never quite that simple—but I think it
actually might be. (These two students are profuse in their praise of me
and my mentorship, I think it’s all so simple it’s not even funny: <em>I
listened, deeply and sincerely, to every single thing they said,
listened attentively to every single thought they shared with me.</em>)
As he notes in his narrative, he came my way with what he describes as a
philosophical position that was “a strong Platonic or neo-Platonic view
of things. I had the making of a fine religious scholar or pre-Kantian
metaphysician, I’m sure,” he writes (4).</p>
<p>Was it good that William and I started, as we did, with the greatest
opponents of Plato, namely, the Sophists? I think so. I quite fondly
recall sending William a copy of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissoi_logoi"><em>Dissoi
Logoi</em></a> and I equally well recall the next time we met—William
had devoured that piece in the meantime—when this text literally split
his mind open in this incredibly beautiful way. I am of the opinion that
all he needed was this tiny little anonymous text that has such
fantastic things to say about language, thinking, philosophy, etc. All
the other thinkers William mentions in his cover letter—and he mentions
so many different philosophers that one starts to reel a little bit—are
so easily connectable to the Sophists’ conception of these things. It’s
such an easy hop-skip-and-a-jump from the <em>Dissoi Logoi</em> to the
likes of Nietzsche, Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, et. al. (Of
course, as William correctly notes, once we had finished the <em>Dissoi
Logoi</em> we went straight to Nietzsche.)</p>
<p>Everything I gave him to read—again, just exactly the same as
MaKenzie here—he consumed with reckless abandon; honestly, it was
shocking—and, as I’ve said before, scary. I always tried to keep in mind
what brought him to me. Most simply put, he had a major question about
hermeneutics, about interpretation. He says that before meeting me, the
question on his mind when reading works of fiction and literature was
always: “what does it <em>mean</em>” (3)? Indeed, a perfectly Platonic
question—and no doubt this is perhaps the major reason why I immediately
threw William towards the Sophists, who were far more interested in what
I will admit I find to be a much more intriguing set of questions—not
“what does it mean,” but “what is this doing,” “how does it
<em>work</em>,” which are <em>the</em> questions par excellence of
<em>rhetoric</em>. The question of “what does it mean,” William suggests
in his cover letter, was absolutely bankrupt for him before reaching out
to me, useless, otiose even. That’s perfectly understandable and, thus,
one needed to give him new tools, new ways of thinking, to try out—maybe
those would work better for him.</p>
<p>It is quite interesting to me that this process of “finding new ways”
for William to think, read, learn, talk, etc. had everything to do with
finagling and tweaking not only the language that he used, but language
itself so often became an object of conversation and study purely in and
of itself. When we started out, it was clear that he and I had quite
drastically different pictures of language and conceptions of what we
thought language was and did. William says his original idea of language
was one that he describes as “a strongly representative or referential
picture of language, grounded in [his] mathematical and Wittgensteinian
commitments” (7). Moreover, he correctly comments that his picture was
one “totally incommensurate with my friend’s.” I think that our early
work together saw us just trying to test out this picture of language
and whether or not it was one that would provide him with some kind of
satisfactory answers to his deep philosophical questions about
literature, truth, ethics, ontology, epistemology; William was harangued
by concerns about the aesthetic relation to all of these areas: how did
art work, what relation did literature and philosophy have with one
another, could you talk about the truly powerful nature of the aesthetic
if you had a perspective on language that saw it as only (merely?) a
tool for
communication?<label for="sn-122" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-122" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="122" class="sidenote">I cannot help but reference, yet again, those
lines from Steiner, <em>op. cit.</em>: “Language is the main instrument
of man’s refusal to accept the world as it is.”</span></p>
<p>I would say that after many months where we read so many dense
philosophical texts together—and William was sliding towards a rather
different picture of language that the one he originally came my way
with—we needed to find some kind of space, some kind of playground, on
which we could test out all of these theories (e.g. psychoanalysis,
structuralism, <a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/">post-structuralism</a>,
and so many more); but not only did we simply want to “test” these
theories, we wanted this “testing” to have an active component—we
wanting this testing to be an <em>experimenting</em> in the original
Latin sense of that word (<em>experimentalis</em>). For me, the real
ground to best see and test out all of the intersections that William
was forging between philosophy, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, and
literature, is, without a doubt, in the work of Shakespeare. I quite
like to think of all philosophical work as merely preparatory for a
reading of Shakespeare; I say that in a somewhat facetious way, but I do
think that a healthy dose of 20th Century Continental Philosophy can be
a fantastic foundation for reading the bard’s work.</p>
<p>I am always endlessly fascinated by which authors light a fire in a
student’s mind that burns so strongly and ferociously that one can see
the brightness light up their face. For MaKenzie, it was Nietzsche,
without a doubt; for William, I think the key thinker was not a
philosopher at all, but a poet, Shakespeare. After roughly a year of
giving him a crash course in Continental Philosophy that would rival
even the best course sequence offered at the graduate school level
(again, this is another exact identical parallel with what MaKenzie
got), we turned our attention to the greatest poet in the English
language.<label for="sn-123" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-123" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="123" class="sidenote">William describes it thusly: “At last, after a
study lasting little under a year, I had acquired something of the true
philosophical attitude; again, with all credit and commendation given to
Dr. Spicer. Such were his patience and generosity that, upon realizing
my progress under him, I felt quite guilty at not having progressed
quicker. And yet, I was all the more delighted, now that I was able, to
keep pace with my mentor during this time” (8).</span> In the Fall of
2022 William and I did sixteen weeks’ worth of intense, careful, and
close reading of Shakespeare’s works; the reading list was largely
designed by William with his own interests and areas of focus always at
the forefront of my mind. We talked about and worked through so many
things in this time period. Out of the plethora of ideas and arguments
and theories we brought to bear on Shakespeare’s works, I would like to
highlight one thread in particular—and then I would like to show what
larger philosophical conclusions about hermeneutics and literary
interpretation we ultimately drew from all of the data points connected
to this thread.</p>
<p>I am not quite exactly certain when this thread bubbled to the
surface, but I do recall that it became very visible to the both of us a
few weeks into the semester when we were scheduled to have a look at the
<em>Henry IV</em> cycle of plays. After a few days talking about the
play as a whole—along with a very deep dive into one of Shakespeare’s
greatest creations, John Falstaff—we got bogged down in all of these
strange resonances between some of the characters in <em>King Henry IV:
Part
I</em>.<label for="sn-124" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-124" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="124" class="sidenote">I am using <em>The Arden Shakespeare</em>
edition of this play edited by David Scott Kastan.</span> William
himself noted all of the uncanny ways in which young Prince Hal is

everyone in the play as
“Hotspur.”<label for="sn-125" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-125" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="125" class="sidenote">Of course, as all readers of this play know,
the original (historical) Harry Percy was quite a bit older than Hal—but
Shakespeare writes Hotspur as roughly the same age as Hal, thus making
very clear this issue of doubling, uncanny similarity, etc.</span> These
two are exact images, doubles, of one another in seemingly every way. Of
course, the mirrorings and doublings do not end there. I remember a
really jam-packed week where we spent hours looking at the battle scenes
at Shrewsbury field in Act V where a bunch of the rebels (Douglas,
Hotspur, et. al.) slice through countless soldiers who are wearing
colors and armor that are similar what the king is currently wearing.
Hal’s father, King Henry, has fashioned countless decoys, leading to
Douglas’s wonderful lines: “Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats.
/ I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece, / Until I meet the King”
(V.iii.26-28). This too is a moment of doubling, simulation, etc. At the
time, I was more than happy to spin this concern towards what I take to
be the play’s larger concerns about King Henry’s goals for legitimizing
his political rule and authoritative power in England. Of course, this
issue of simulation and doubling becomes fraught, tangled, and gnarly.
If the king can be impersonated, if one can fashion a decoy of the King,
how unassailable is his authority? It’s so far from unassailable it’s
not even funny, the play seems to
suggest.<label for="sn-126" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-126" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="126" class="sidenote">This should remind readers of the treatment of
this very same idea that MaKenzie and I unearthed through different

Shrew</em>, see <em>supra</em>.</span></p>
<p>This issue of the “twins” (both Hal and Harry Percy) and of kingly
doubles and decoys became something of a mantra for us as the reading
continued each week. William came to find more and more spots where
Shakespeare has recourse to this theme of twins: he saw it in
<em>Twelfth Night</em> with Viola and her twin brother; he saw in the
obsession with mirrors in <em>Richard II</em> and with rhetorical
deception and dissimulation in <em>Richard III</em>; he very easily saw
it in Hamlet and Fortinbras; he detected it brilliantly in the doubling
ambiguity of the witches’ riddles in <em>Macbeth</em>; he found it
absolutely perfectly in the rivalry between Coriolanus and Aufidius; he
pinpointed it very carefully and closely in all the shenanigans that
occur towards the end of <em>Measure for Measure</em> (not to mention
the bizarre “bed trick” that occurs between Angelo and Mariana in this
play); he unearthed it beautifully in numerous spots in
<em>Cymbeline</em>. He started to notice and see it absolutely
everywhere. Having seen this repeated refrain/motif, the natural
question was <em>what one wanted to do with</em> this Shakespearean
obsession.</p>
<p>When thinking about doubles and twins, about repetitions (both
conscious and unconscious) those of a psychoanalytic bent are apt to
turn immediately and directly to Freud’s famous essay, “The
Uncanny.”<label for="sn-127" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-127" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="127" class="sidenote">For William’s stellar work on

All references to this paper will appear parenthetically in the main
text.</span>This is exactly what William did. At this time, we were also
slowly making our way through what many consider to be Deleuze’s
masterpiece, <em>Difference and
Repetition</em>.<label for="sn-128" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-128" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="128" class="sidenote">Gilles Deleuze, <em>Difference and
Repetition</em>, trans. Paul Patton (New York: Columbia UP,
1994).</span> This is an incredibly dense and difficult text—not for the
faint of heart at all. I should say that we easily (beautifully, and
wonderfully) got bogged down in the very “Introduction” to the text—and
once again we spent many days wrestling with the first opening sections
of this awesome text. The key passage in particular that got William’s
motor running was the second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generality presents two major orders: the qualitative order of
resemblances and the quantitative order of equivalences. Cycles and
equalities are their respective symbols. But in any case, generality
expresses a point of view according to which one term may be exchanged
or substituted for another. The exchange or substitution of particulars
defines our conduct in relation to generality. … By contrast, we can see
that repetition is a necessary and justified conduct only in relation to
that which cannot be replaced. <em>Repetition as a conduct and as a
point of view concerns non-exchangeable and non-substitutable
singularities. Reflections, echoes, doubles and souls do not belong to
the domain of resemblance or equivalence; and it is no more possible to
exchange one’s soul than it its to substitute two real twins for one
another.</em><label for="sn-129" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-129" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="129" class="sidenote">Ibid., p. 1, emphasis mine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>William latched on (again, in that “steel trap” way that is so unique
and singular to him) to this assertion about an absolute difference
between a reflection and a resemblance. What does this mean, he wondered
aloud to me one day. What would it mean, exactly, to say that the image
of myself in the mirror didn’t really <em>resemble</em> me, but,
instead, <em>repeated</em> me? Indeed, what a wonderful question.
Deleuze says that resemblances within the qualitative order introduce us
to generalities, categories shared in common by two different things
where those categories could be substituted and exchanged for one
another. Can my image in the mirror “replace” me in some way? Nope. Can
I swap my reflection out and have it go into the office for me while I
stay behind reading Hegel? Not at all. My image in the mirror doesn’t at
all <em>resemble</em> me; it <em>repeats</em> me as an absolutely
singular singularity that is “non-exchangeable and”non-substitutable.”
One could say that a bunch of mandarin oranges in the grocery store
“resemble” one another, but each does not “repeat” the others … As I
say, a very interesting angle here on ideas that many might consider to
be somewhat unimpeachable and hardly problematic at all.</p>
<p>William was so terribly fascinated by Deleuze’s treatment of
generality, repetition, resemblance, and the need to try to keep some of
these things conceptually separate and distinct from one another. He was
also—I’m sure this is probably pretty obvious from the drift of my
narrative here so far—really curious to see what Deleuze’s language
might offer him when thinking about all of the doubling and twining that
he was seeing in Shakespeare’s plays. We spent many hours talking about
Deleuze’s mention of “reflections” as we had talked a ton about the
function of mirrors in some of the early history plays, especially
<em>Richard II</em>. But I think the usefulness really came about in
William’s marshaling of this Deleuzian language to talk about
<em>Coriolanus</em>. But before jumping to that play—and to William’s
very masterful reading of it—, I need to say a little bit more about
Freud and psychoanalysis here.</p>
<p>After wrestling and wrangling with the first couple chapters of
<em>Difference and Repetition</em>—including the very key sections in
Chapter 2 where Deleuze tries to demarcate his differences from Freud’s
conception and use of repetition—I told him (rather offhandedly, if I
remember correctly) that it surprised me that Deleuze doesn’t at all
mention Freud’s “Uncanny” essay (<em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em>
is the main text investigated here in <em>D&amp;R</em>, which makes
perfect sense, but still, odd that he doesn’t mention it at all). As is
so par for the course for William, he wanted the Freud essay, which I
sent his way, along with a really fantastic book by Nicholas
Royle.<label for="sn-130" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-130" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="130" class="sidenote">Nicholas Royle, <em>The Uncanny</em>

id="132" class="sidenote">I might also mention how I sent him Mladen
Dolar’s very nice little essay, “‘I Shall Be with You on Your
Wedding-Night’: Lacan and the Uncanny,” <em>October</em>, Vol. 58
(Autumn, 1991), pp. 5-23, which, again, he read in less than a
day.</span>—a day later he was back in the office to tell me about how
fantastic Royle’s book was—and how strange (dare we say “uncanny”?) it
was that Deleuze doesn’t mention this text of Freud that one could say
is, somehow, even more concerned with repetition than <em>Beyond the
Pleasure Principle</em>. William quickly became convinced—I have no
doubt here that Royle’s just solidified an intuition that William had
already had about Shakespeare’s dramas—that Shakespeare was on to this
idea of the
“uncanny.”<label for="sn-131" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-131" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="131" class="sidenote">Indeed, the index of Royle’s book lists 38
references to texts within Shakespeare’s corpus (p. 338).</span> He was
also thoroughly convinced that the best way to talk about all these
doubles and twins and reflections was not through the language of
resemblance, but, rather, it was Deleuze’s conception of “repetition”
that was key here. Has there ever been another Coriolanus? Absolutely
not. Does Coriolanus uncannily <em>resemble</em> his arch-rival (at
least in the first half of the play), Aufidius, when the former switches
allegiances from Rome to the Volscians camped outside Rome’s walls or
does he not rather <em>repeat</em> him? William says it is <em>not a
matter of resemblance</em>—in so many ways Aufidius looks nothing like
Coriolanus and yet these two do engage in a dance of repetitions of one
another.</p>
<p>The thing about doubles and doubling that so fascinated William was
why it seems to be the case that in so many literary stories and
fictions, the text always has to end up with one of the two dead. In
order to get at this issue, we again went to the infinitely rich well
that is psychoanalysis—in particular, I passed William an early essay by
Mladen Dolar where he speaks to this concern quite directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject is confronted with his double, the very image of himself
(that can go along with the disappearance, or trading off, of his mirror
image or his shadow), and this crumbling of the subject’s accustomed
reality, this shattering of the bases of his world, produces a terrible
anxiety. Usually only the subject can see his own double, who takes care
to appear only in private, or for the subject alone. The double produces
two seemingly contradictory effects: he arranges things so that they
turn out badly for the subject, he turns up at the most inappropriate
moments, he dooms him to failure; and he realizes the subject’s hidden
or repressed desires so that he does things he would never dare to do or
that his conscience wouldn’t let him do. In the end, the relation gets
so unbearable that the subject, in a final showdown, kills his double,
unaware that his only substance and his very being were concentrated in
his double. So in killing him he kills himself. “You have conquered, and
I yield,” says Wilson’s double in Poe’s story. “Yet henceforward art
thou also dead—dead to the World, to Heaven, and to Hope! In me didst
thou exist—and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how
utterly thou hast murdered thyself.” As a rule, all these stories finish
badly: the moment one encounters one’s double, one is headed for
disaster; there seems to be no way out. (In clinical cases of
autoscopia—meeting or seeing one’s double-the prognosis is also rather
bad and the outcome is likely to be
tragic.)<label for="sn-133" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-133" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="133" class="sidenote">Dolar, p. 11.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is itself borne-out by the text of <em>Coriolanus</em>: the
title character ends up dead, his double, Aufidius, surviving him. As
William puts it so wonderfully in his essay’s concluding paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is the tragedy of Coriolanus. His transformation from Martius
Coriolanus to Martius Aufidius to Martius has all been for naught. In
uniting the common and the proper, he comes too near Aufidius, repeats
him too well. In signing the treaty, Martius becomes both a Roman and a
Volsce. This pricks too near Aufidius’ heart, presents him with his
mortality in too raw a fashion. Therefore does he murder Martius. He
finally betrays his double. (13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it goes without saying that William’s essay is an absolutely
stellar and fantastic example of “applied knowledge” at work. He
consumed a bunch of theoretical, secondary materials and then brought
them to bear very strongly on one of Shakespeare’s plays. As I say, it
is wonderfully and expertly done. I could not be more proud of him for
this work.</p>
<p>Now, when a student does this kind of excellent application-work, it
warms a teacher’s heart, to be sure. But I should say that it didn’t
just give me a warm-and-fuzzy feeling. What it did was fuel my own
thinking in incredibly profound ways that I would like to try to talk a
little bit more about now here. All of this talk of doubles, twins,
reflections, and repetitions couldn’t help but get me thinking back to
all kinds of concerns that also arose in MaKenzie’s “Ancient Literature”
course where we read about all kinds of twins: Jacob and Esau, of
course, but also that wonderful pair of sisters, Leah and Rachel. If
William and I hadn’t been working our way through the Deleuze, I’m not
quite sure the stars would have aligned in quite the way they did.
Working as closely with both William and MaKenzie in the Fall of 2022
was such a perfect storm: it produced all these insanely profound
feedback loops where discussions and readings with one of them would
intensify and strengthen the texts and ideas I was working on with the
other. This focus on twins, doubles, and repetitions definitely did a
ton of work for me—and also made the work on the “theological allegory”
in Millet’s novel (and that shows up in the coauthored paper with
MaKenzie) such a breeze to see and flesh
out.<label for="sn-165" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-165" class="margin-toggle"/><span

<p>The roots of the whole Rachel, Leah, Jacob, twins and doubling nexus
goes all the way back to my earliest days with MaKenzie. One day we were
talking about feminism and I asked her if she happened to have read
Margaret Atwood’s brilliant <em>The Handmaid’s
Tale</em>?<label for="sn-134" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-134" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="134" class="sidenote">Margaret Atwood, <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>

this novel has an epigraph at the beginning that directly cites the
story of Rachel and Leah (Genesis 30:1-3). MaKenzie and I read Atwood’s
book over the summer of 2021 and promised that we would link back up to
it as we made our way through the Genesis text, to go “back to the
original” story that served as Atwood’s
epigraph.<label for="sn-135" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-135" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="135" class="sidenote">I should say here that MaKenzie and I have a
long-running list of article projects that we plan to tackle (again)
together, an essay on Atwood is one of the most key ones—as MaKenzie has
been profoundly itching to write about this novel after reading it that
summer a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p>I have always loved the story of Leah and Rachel—and Jacob. I have
particularly adored—sigh, I’m not quite sure what this says about me,
lots, I’m sure—the infamous “bed trick” that Laban pulls here in Genesis
29. After seven years of working for Laban in order to earn Rachel’s
hand, we get Jacob’s request: “Then Jacob said to Laban, ‘Give me my
wife, for my time is fulfilled, that I may cohabit with her’” (29:21).
The text continues: “When evening came, he took his daughter Leah and
brought her to him; and he cohabited with her” (29:23). So here one
could say that we get a “substitution” of sorts: Leah for Rachel. The
text is quite beautiful in its shock, surprise, and incredulity—feelings
that no doubt Jacob himself shares and feels himself: “When the morning
came,” the narrator says, “there was Leah! So he said to Laban, ‘What is
this you have done to me? I was in your service for Rachel! Why did you
deceive me?’” As is so often the case, <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.25?lang=bi&amp;with=Rashi&amp;lang2=en">Rashi’s
commentary</a> is beautifully perspicacious (and alluringly,
seductively, tantalizing) in its attentiveness to this “bed trick”
moment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AND IT CAME TO PASS, THAT IN THE MORNING, BEHOLD, IT WAS LEAH —But at
night it was not Leah (i.e. he failed to recognise that it was Leah)
because Jacob had given Rachel certain secret signs by which they could
at all times recognise one another, and when Rachel saw that they were
about to bring Leah to him for the marriage ceremony, she thought, “My
sister may now be put to shame”, and she therefore readily transmitted
these signs to her (<em>Megillah 13b</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary here is so short, so cryptic, so bizarre (for many
readers!). Rashi’s marginalia here is only a single sentence in
length—and yet it opens up so much! Where is this detail in the original
text that Rashi extrapolates: namely, this little detail that one sister
shares the secret signs with the other so that when Jacob and Leah meet
in the night, it will <em>not</em> be a meeting of Jacob and Leah but of
Jacob and Leah-as-Rachel? Nowhere that I can see. Of course, such
creative ingenuity never stopped any of the Rabbinic commentators from
“adding it to” the text (if that is indeed the way one would like to
describe what is happening here with Rashi’s hermeneutics). Are these
signs given to Leah by Rachel so that the former can merely “resemble”
the latter—or are they not given so that one can (and here I mean this
to be parsed incredibly <em>literally</em>) <em>become</em> (or
“repeat,” in Deleuze’s register) the other
sister?<label for="sn-136" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-136" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="136" class="sidenote">We should also mention here how the treatment
of this same scene in <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah?tab=contents"><em>Bereishit
Rabbah</em></a> 70:17 makes this “becoming” even more clear: “But I
called you ‘Rachel,’” the commentary has Jacob say, “and you answered
me!” Leah <em>literally becomes</em> Rachel; she does not merely
<em>resemble</em> her, she <em>repeats</em> her, <em>becomes her</em> in
an absolutely singular way.</span></p>
<p>Although William and I did not really chase the “doubling” and
“twinning” involved in the bed trick that shows up so frequently in
Shakespeare’s corpus (which, as already mentioned, is present in
<em>Measure for Measure</em>, but is also there in <em>All’s Well That
Ends Well</em> and, arguably, even in the odd little nighttime-trick
that Iachimo/Giacomo gets up to in <em>Cymbeline</em>), I can easily
imagine some work where we continued to try to draw out these
through-lines.<label for="sn-137" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-137" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="137" class="sidenote">I know for a fact that MaKenzie will want to
pick up this thread in the Atwood project, as the spin given on the
whole “bed trick” is incredibly odd and quite peculiar in <em>The

story really runs off the rails, at least in my own personal
reading.</span> I suppose all I want to make clear here is how mutually
supportive (and reinforcing) the work with William often became for the
work MaKenzie and I were doing—and vice versa, too. I am not certain
that I could have really grown my thinking about these ancient stories
without William around; in fact, I’m certain such growth for me wouldn’t
have happened at all had it not been for him.</p>

<p>Before I transition here, I want to go back again to MaKenzie: “What
was (and still is!) always so wonderful about our conversations is that
I never feel like Spicer is talking down to me; and the moments where I
taught him something or pointed out something he hadn’t seen are
incredibly genuine.” As I tried to make really clear, this was never
just posturing on my part. Working with MaKenzie and William has allowed
me to learn so many new things—I couldn’t list them all even if I had
“world enough and time,” as Andrew Marvell says. I would like to canvas,
however, just a couple of slightly different things that I have learned
from studying, reading, thinking, and talking with William over the past
two years—and both of these things are brand-new and very recent.</p>
<p>I find that when talking with William, he has a plethora of different
fields that he loves to use to flesh out difficult ideas in different
realms: the biggest and most significant one seems to me to almost
always come from the realm of music. He is himself an avid guitarist and
piano player and loves talking to me about jazz (if one pokes their head
in the office when he comes by—and the chances are good that if you
still poke your head in even now, either MaKenzie or William will
probably be in there—, they can tell just by looking at his face alone
that he’s drawing parallels and analogues to music). I have confessed to
him on numerous occasions that despite the fact that I myself live with
three musicians (my wife is a guitarist, my son is a violinist, my
youngest loves playing the piano and her ukulele), I don’t understand a
single darn thing about music. William likes to say that my areas of
expertise are “immense” and very wide-ranging. Music is <em>not</em> one
of the areas across which my knowledge ranges—far from it; I’m perfect
illiterate when it comes to music. That said, I have found myself
becoming more and more intrigued by the way in which William very
brilliantly utilizes music in order to do philosophy. (I will never
forget the week this past February when William downed the entirety of
the 11th Plateau, “1837: Of the Refrain,” in Deleuze and Guattari’s
<em>A Thousand
Plateaus</em><label for="sn-138" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-138" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="138" class="sidenote">Deleuze and Guattari, <em>
Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</em>, pp. 351-423.</span>, with
him immediately saying how right he thought this pair of thinkers was on
tonality and atonality in music.) More often than not, I can track the
analogies and analogues—although, without him I wouldn’t have had a
prayer in the world of doing such a thing, especially since I’ve always
found that 11th Plateau to be totally opaque to me, no doubt due to the
musical illiteracy I already mentioned)—and I have found his use of
music and music theory to greatly enrich my own thoughts about
aesthetics, aesthetic creativity, and so much more. As I have already
noted, William’s first forays (in my direction) were in search of ways
to talk about aesthetic creation and artistic ingenuity and innovation.
I must admit that I have—prior to meeting William—never really been all
that interested in such things. However, William has pushed me to wonder
if I can still get away with such a position; now I am not so sure I am
able to really be able to do what I want in conversations with him
without having some kind of recourse to a discussion of aesthetic
creativity when talking about how a particular poem or play or novel or
work of art really works on and does things out in the world. This is
undoubtedly a part of my academic being that was added by William—no
other source is possible. I think we want our students to be able to
change us—and to really change us such that our students can say of us,
as MaKenzie did, that <em>she taught her teacher</em>, <em>she taught
her mentor</em> something that he didn’t know before. I would guess that
William might be somewhat hesitant to agree that he managed to do this
for me, but his reserved nature and quiet caution are completely and
totally unwarranted here. MaKenzie drastically changed me; William did
too. If our students can’t do this to us, one wonders what it is we’re
all up to here in this whole pedagogical enterprise in the first place,
at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Here is perhaps the great example (humbly submitted into evidence/the
record here)—that MaKenzie’s sentiment that there was something
“genuine” about how I was changed by them is not mere window-dressing
and not mere polite rhetoric—occurred just a week or so ago when William
and I spent multiple days in a row reading the work of one of William’s
most favorite and most beloved literary writers (and one of my most
disliked), Ernest Hemingway. I would like to relay a little story about
this now so that it is blindingly clear how much my students have
changed me and some of my most long-held positions. I have never been
big on Hemingway—I read his novels when I was around William’s age, but
gravitated to quite different modernist writers than he did. I loved the
work of Proust, Joyce, Pound, Woolf, Faulkner—Hemingway was never top of
the list for me. William would so frequently talk to me of his great
admiration of Hemingway (and Fitzgerald too, I should add); I guess it’s
possible that I got it when I was his age (although I’m not quite sure
that I did even back then) and I really didn’t get it either twenty
years later. That is, until William and I spent a whole week looking at
some of his most favorite Hemingway stories.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if he would describe it this way—but I sometimes think
(with all the good-natured and -willed levity and friendly ribbing I can
muster)—that trying to find things that he and I greatly disagreed about
(long after we learned how to think, read, and talk with another)—could
become something akin to some sort of parlor came William might play.
Over the past couple of years we did sync up our thinking quite
strongly—though not on the question of Hemingway. My position on his
work was far from principled—it was silly, juvenile even, one might say.
I just didn’t really at all care for some of the typical
“Hemingway-esque” techniques of narrative and imagistic description that
William so clearly enjoyed. I told him I could definitely understand
what Hemingway’s “minimalistic” style wanted to achieve: a plethora of
meaning in an incredibly short space, a profound parsimony of language
that would open-up and unfurl in all kinds of different ways. Still, I
just couldn’t see it in the works—couldn’t locate it; at the end of the
day, I just didn’t know what to do with these things. I have a feeling
that William would (and I know MaKenzie would) say that everything one
might want to know about me as a teacher, learner, and mentor was there
to be seen one Thursday when I told him (after we had argued back and
forth for hours about characterization in <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>):
“Okay, my friend, it’s been two decades since I read one of Hemingway’s
books; this weekend I’ll go back and reread one.” “You don’t have to do
that,” he said, “you don’t need to come to love Hemingway in the way
that I do.” Of course, I knew that, but I still felt as if I couldn’t
really spar with William on this terrain—my engine here was not
well-oiled, it was no doubt rusty; I needed to open up the hood
again.</p>
<p>I took the weekend to reread this novel. Nope, I still couldn’t
really stand it, any of it. Don’t get me wrong, I understood the book—I
understood the crippling ennui, the typical “ex-patriot” despondency,
the despair, the emptiness, the profound nihilism—I have never been a
stranger to such things (well, excepting the “ex-patriot” adjective, of
course). All of this is so elementary, so par for the course, about a
novel whose epigraph from Gertrude Stein reads, “You are all a lost
generation.” I spent all weekend trying to articulate some slightly more
substantial criticisms of the text, but the vacuity, the vapidity, the
emptiness, and the giant gaping void at the center of Hemingway’s work
irritated me (still) to no end. I rehearsed all kinds of possibilities.
Why, exactly, should one prefer the hamstrung way Hemingway’s style and
technique worked—this question was, perhaps, quite particular to me, who
loves the sublime long-windedness of, say, Dickens’ narrative lines, or
the profound use to which Austen utilizes the already mentioned “free
indirect discourse” to get inside her characters’ heads. I just couldn’t
understand; I just didn’t know, still, <em>what to do with this
thing</em>. All the characters in Hemingway, dripping with
alienation—from themselves, from each other, from their world, even from
their pleasures. This alienation touches everything—even the very fact
of talking has become so useless, characters constantly tell each other
to “just stop
talking.”<label for="sn-139" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-139" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="139" class="sidenote">Utilizing, via synecdoche, one example to
serve as exemplary of all the rest, here is an exchange between Brett
and “the count” in Chapter VII: “The count reached down and twirled the
bottles in the shiny bucket. ‘It isn’t cold, yet. You’re always
drinking, my dear. Why don’t you just talk?’ ‘I’ve talked too ruddy
much. I’ve talked myself all out to Jake.’ ‘I should like to hear you
really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your
sentences at all.’ ‘Leave ’em for you to finish. Let any one finish them
as they like’” (58).</span> Nothing upon this second read computed at
all—who wants to bother reading a novel where the characters are so
alienated from their own words, saying they don’t need to finish any of
their sentences because it’s all the same to them how someone other than
them would finish those very same sentences? As I say, I just couldn’t
make anything with this text, couldn’t connect it up with anything else,
just could not at all make any of it go … anywhere. Coming from the
likes of Dickens and Austen and the Brontë sisters, I just couldn’t
stomach it at all.</p>
<p>This very same weekend—as I was trying, genuinely, authentically,
sincerely—to come William’s way <em>re</em> Hemingway, he himself
started reading two of my most favorite novels by Dickens (again, as his
way of trying to get a sense, via contrast, of my own position in order
to come closer to
me).<label for="sn-140" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-140" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="140" class="sidenote">These two novels are, of course, his
masterpieces, <em>Bleak House</em> and <em>Our Mutual
Friend</em>.</span> We spent a morning during the Hemingway week where
we spent hours looking at the opening to <em>Bleak House</em>,
cataloguing Dickens’ brilliant use of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle">participles</a> to
fashion the environment created by the all-consuming fog in this novel,
which itself becomes one of the major leitmotivs that course and move
all throughout the entirety of the book. I could see—as I’ve seen on his
face innumerable times—the way this careful and close reading of Dickens
narrative (and syntactical) technique showed William things in this
passage that he’d never seen before, never thought about before. The
complexity of these typically Dickensian techniques is shockingly
brilliant and masterful. “Where can I see something similar to this
happening in Hemingway,” I jokingly goaded him. There is no doubt
whatsoever that one can put these authors on frighteningly different
sides of the spectrum when it comes to narrative technique and literary
methodology. I asked William if he would be willing to play a little
game here, do me a little favor: Could he take Friday and the weekend to
pick out some of his most favorite Hemingway works and do something
similar to what I did with the opening three paragraphs from Dickens? He
said it would be hard to pick out his favorites, but promised to give it
a shot. Later that day, he texted me a short list of his favorite short
stories: “The Killers,” “Cat in the Rain,” “In Another Country,” “Hills
Like White Elephants,” “Old Man at the Bridge,” “Today is
Friday.”<label for="sn-141" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-141" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="141" class="sidenote">All these stories can be found in <em>The
Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigía Edition</em>
(New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1987).</span> Pulling “a William,” I
immediately read these stories, incredibly excited and enthused by the
idea that William would be trying to show me what he saw in these things
that I just saw absolutely nothing in, if I’m being at all honest.</p>
<p>William says in his cover letter that one of the things that became
clearer and clearer under my mentorship was the importance and profound
significance of one’s be willing to never rest on their laurels, to
always, <em>always</em>, question their own positions on things: “It is
the ultimate failure of the intellectual, I’ve learned, to hold too
tightly to one’s ideas and commitments” (5). I was very honestly trying
to do this, to continue putting this sentiment into practice—this time
with Hemingway. The parameters of this exercise were, on the surface,
something a little different from the way in which William and I usually
worked. I put William in the role of authority and expert—which is
hardly a fiction as he’s a much better reader and scholar of Hemingway
than I am, that’s for sure!—so that he could teach me how to read this
author’s works. When it came time to dive in, William’s standard
cautiousness was on full display here; he said that he was prepared to
take me step-by-step through the stories, but, that said, there were
still little spots and details in the story that he himself confessed he
“didn’t quite know what to do with.” Perfectly fine, I said—we’d give it
a shot and see what would come out of it all.</p>
<p>We started with “In Another Country” and William took me through
nearly every sentence, every word, showing me how he thought things were
working, what they were doing, etc. (I should note here that the days
when William would relentlessly worry over questions of “what does this
mean?!” were long gone; here he was putting all his learning into
practice: focusing with his rare doggedness on <em>what the text was
doing</em>.<label for="sn-142" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-142" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="142" class="sidenote">William’s transition was remarkable as it was
a movement away from his Platonist/Wittgensteinian/deeply mathematical
conception of language and meaning to thinking about texts and language
as fundamentally <em>machinic</em>. As Deleuze and Guattari put it on
the very first page of <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>: “Everywhere it is
machines—real ones, not figurative ones—machines driving other machines,
machines being driven by other machines, with all the necessary
couplings and connections.” Everything is in this switch to machinery,
and Graham Harman put the consequences of this best in his
<em>Object-Oriented Ontology: A New Theory of Everything</em> (London,
UK: Bloomsbury, 2018) when he writes: “what a machine <em>does</em> is
more important than what it <em>is</em>” (p. 228).</span>) William
deftly noticed all the spots that so often give Hemingway a distinctly
“nihilistic” tint and tone: the alienation, the ennui, the despondency,
the despair—all of these were present in the story. Moreover, I found
William highlighting and extracting out certain key phrases, ideas,
images, repetitions, on so on, that I myself noticed too. Slowly, I was
starting to find some things here that I just could not find before?
Why, though? Weren’t those things there already to be found. Why is it
that I was only starting to see them while in (and after) conversation
with William? I think this is no doubt one of the absolutely magical—and
still mysterious—things about learning to “think <em>with</em>, really
<em>with</em> another person” and this all reminds me of something else
William wrote (though in this context the movement was him getting in
step with me while in this Hemingway case the situation was the
reverse—me getting in step with him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This pattern, quite reminiscent of what Deleuze wrote of his
relationship with Guattari - something to the effect of “Felix would say
things to me, and though I’d know exactly what he said, I wouldn’t
understand it until six months after” - would continue throughout my
study of the bard. Spicer would say things to me that I knew were
unbelievably insightful and profound, but wouldn’t be able to understand
them for weeks after. And once I did, I would drag him (willingly, I
should say) back to that play or poem, and we’d play again the tune we’d
both heard before, now tapping our feet in the same tempo. (9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something similar was happening here with me and Hemingway—all due to
William, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>We spent all week literally picking these stories apart, tearing them
up, jamming our tools inside them, opening them, figuring out how they
worked, what they were doing, <em>how</em> they were doing what they
were doing. Something opened up for me here too. I was especially able
to get my own tools to work really quite nicely with Hemingway’s “Today
is Friday,” where William and I got to rehearse the Deleuzian claims
about “repetition” and their relation to Christ’s crucifixion in this
story. (This is a really wonderful little Hemingway text, for those that
don’t know it—and I recommend everyone take a gander at it.) Now, to be
completely honest, despite how truly wonderful exercise was for me, I am
not sure that, afterwards, I was really any more able to stomach all the
despondency and despair in Hemingway. I was, however, able to get these
texts to do something—and that’s something that I wasn’t able to do
before William took me through these stories <em>in his own unique and
completely singular way</em>. We did something similar for other stories
that I was able to open up incredibly: “Hills Like White Elephants” in
particular was one that we, again, spent hours looking at closely and
carefully together. Have I come to “love” this author’s work in the same
exact way William does? No, I don’t think so—but I do “get them” and I
do have a much better sense of seeing why it is that William returns to
them again and again in the same way I do with the novels of Dickens,
the poetry of Shakespeare, or the riddling obscurities of the ancient
Hebrew Bible texts. What a gift for a teacher and mentor to have been
given by their student and mentee.</p>
<p>Good teaching—and good learning too, for that matter—must always be
symmetrical, must always be intensely symmetrical. If students don’t
teach their teachers something, if they don’t help their mentors see
something new that they didn’t see before, then there’s no doubt that a
wonderful opportunity has been missed—clearly missed, I should say.</p>
<h3 id="concluding-remarks-on-williams-trajectory">1.2.3 Concluding
Remarks on William’s Trajectory</h3>
<p>I wanted to begin this section with a series of rhetorical questions,
something like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How exactly is one to talk about a student who has had the most
profound and significant impact on one as a teacher? How should one best
discuss someone who is by far one of the greatest students one has ever
had in an entire twenty-year long teaching career? How might one try to
articulate how exemplary, unique, and singular such a student is at the
end of the day? How ought one discuss the enormously important
intellectual rapport they have developed with this student? How does one
talk about a student that one feels is probably one of the greatest
students they will ever have, no matter how many students they might
encounter in the future? Nietzsche says somewhere that it is a poor
student who never surpasses her teacher. And how indeed to talk about a
student who will, without a doubt, achieve this Nietzschean
recommendation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These would, I am certain, strike my readers here as, in fact,
perfectly rhetorical. Haven’t I done exactly this? How to talk about a
student William? Well, the answer’s already here before any and every
reader of these thoughts. Still, I want to re-spin the record, assuming
my readers might still be willing to indulge me this, and say something
a little new, say something a little different than I did above.</p>
<p>I know in the section devoted to MaKenzie’s work, I cited those
wonderful lines from Phillips about “unofficial interests.” I want to
return to that here. I have also already mentioned how William’s cover
letter of interest for pursuing graduate-level work talks a great deal
of the work that he and I have done together (I myself have already
talked about this at length too now). I would just like to note that all
of that work falls strictly within the realm of Phillips’ “unofficial
interests.”” William graduated from USF this past December with a degree
in mathematics. All of the conversations that William and I have had
over the past two years about everything had absolutely nothing
whatsoever to do with his “official” focus on mathematics. Of course, I
do not mean to suggest that William just slogged through his mathematics
work and courses, just trying to “get by” with interests handed to him
by others. That said, it’s been clear to me—already from the very first
day that we met—that the real spark of joy and enjoyment in William came
not in the realm of mathematics, but in the field of philosophy. If one
glances at his transcripts, they’ll see very few courses that fall under
my area of expertise as a member of the English Department (which,
obviously, makes perfect sense for a mathematics major at a liberal arts
university that, somehow, does not offer a BA in philosophy); this is
just another way to say that William possesses a profound
inquisitiveness and intellectual curiosity that I have never seen in any
other student in my entire twenty-year career as a professor, teacher,
and educator (excluding, just for the moment, MaKenzie, of course). Such
a thing is so rare that it is difficult to find the words best suited to
describe how profoundly open to philosophy, open to thinking, in
general, William is at the end of the day—and I hope this reflection has
given readers just a tiny little taste of this truth.</p>
<p>I, as William’s mentor (it’s possible this isn’t quite the right
word, maybe something simpler like “intellectual conversation partner”
is more accurate—yet, I second-guess myself even here as I have not
hesitated in this reflection to use that moniker—and MaKenzie’s argument
that this word needs to be the one we used precisely because of its
already mentioned “lack of an expiration date” quality to it has really
convinced me fully), rubbed off on him quite a bit—maybe perhaps too
much. I myself—as a student and even still now as a professor—find
myself interested in everything, always wanting to learn whatever I can
about everything I can. William’s disposition and personality strikes me
as eerily comparable to my own. So much of the thinking, reading, and
conversing together that William and I have done has been laser-focused
in on his purely “unofficial interests”—and this seems to me to be the
greatest recommendation that one could give in terms of his potential:
he’s chased an enormous quantity of knowledge of the philosophical
tradition—with especial focus, as his cover letter and my reflection
here both highlight, on the Continental tradition post-Kant. It is
possible to unearth from Phillips’ work on Freud what a good teacher
looks like: she is someone who gets a sense of what it is that drives a
student, what it is they enjoy and love doing, and then they teach to
that—each and every time hoping to increase the intensity of that
enjoyment and love. It is even better—“perfectly ideal,” one might
say—when a teacher can say to a student, as Deleuze was so fond of
noting, that increasing this intensity is something that the student and
teacher must do together. As Deleuze puts it, in trying to describe how
one might “teach someone to swim”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The movement of the swimmer does not resemble that of the wave, in
particular, the movements of the swimming instructor which we reproduce
on the sand bear no relation to the movements of the wave, which we
learn to deal with only by grasping the former in practice as signs.
That is why it is so difficult to say how someone learns: there is an
innate or acquired practical familiarity with signs, which means that
there is something amorous—but also something fatal—about all education.
We learn nothing from those who say: “Do as I do”. Our only teachers are
those who tell us to “do with me”, and are able to emit signs to be
developed in heterogeneity rather than propose gestures for us to
reproduce.<label for="sn-143" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-143" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="143" class="sidenote"><em>Difference and Repetition</em>, p. 23. I
cite this passage <br /> too many times to count in my “Reflection,” <em>op.
cit.</em>, <br /> on MaKenzie’s work.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to say how invigorating this pedagogical (and
philosophical) focus here is; how right is Deleuze to say that one
learns best not when the teacher says, “Do exactly like me,” but,
instead, “Do with me”? I think he is 100% correct and it is this issue
of the “with” that has been so central when I think back on my time with
William. No doubt it is even more true to draw the conclusion from this
that Deleuze does: “there is something amorous … about all education.””
Quite true. William’s unofficial interests led him to me, led him to
someone that tried to incarnate this Deleuzian idea that one learns best
when one does something with
another.<label for="sn-144" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-144" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="144" class="sidenote">Obviously, and this probably goes without
saying, this idea could serve as the entire mantra of all the work with
MaKenzie, too.</span> I would like to say—trying to maintain as much
humility as I possibly can here, as it is my usual <em>modus
operandi</em>, as I’ve already said countless times before—that
William’s intellectual growth over a very short period of time has been
nothing short of staggering, breath-taking. He will say that it is all
due to me, but that is not quite right: this growth did not happen due
to either one of us alone, it happened in that space of “the between,”
it happened in between the two of us as a pair of thinkers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above numerous times, exceptional and exemplary students
like William are all the same, so the mantra goes—but one still needs to
find the unique way into their thinking, into their reading and
exegesis, into their worlds. Many incredibly brilliant students want you
to push them, to push them in every way—to push their thinking, to push
their arguments, to push their reading and writing. Others do not
necessarily want a challenge, per se; they are after something slightly
different. It seems to me (and I pray it seems this way to my readers
now, too) that what William wanted was a partner, a mentor that could
help him find new ways to handle the philosophical problems that
intrigued, obsessed, and so often frustrated him (“frustration” should
by no means be read in a negative way
here<label for="sn-167" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-167" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="167" class="sidenote">Here I cannot help but think of that passage
from Nietzsche’s <em>The Will to Power</em>, ed. Walter Kaufmann, trans.
Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale (New York: Vintage Books, 2011):
“One should not conceal and corrupt the <em>fact</em> that our thoughts
come to us in a fortuitous fashion. The profoundest and least exhausted
books will probably also have something of the aphoristic and
<em>unexpected</em> character of Pascal’s <em>Pensées</em>. The driving
forces and the evaluations lay below the surface a long time; what comes
out is effect” (Section 424, p. 229). MaKenzie definitely helped these
driving forces come to the surface.</span>). He wanted someone to give
him a toolbox to help him unlock things, texts, ideas, arguments. He
will say I did that for him and so, so much more. It is often difficult
for us teachers to accept how profoundly impactful we can be on our
students and the trajectories of their lives (or maybe it is just
difficult for me in particular)—no doubt this becomes even more legible
and palpable when we think about our most gifted students. I know he
will describe me as doing this for him—impacting him in ways that are
impossible to fully enumerate and account for. As I say, I am not sure
it’s rocket science: just find the student’s path of desire, how that
desire works and wants to function, and then speak to that. Simple
enough. Partners, true (thinking) partners along every single step of
the journey—with a promise to do that for them long, long into the
future. William, in particular, sought me out, sought me out with the
hopes that I could be someone to help him open things, ideas, etc. up. I
would like to say that I was successful in giving him what he wanted,
what he needed, what he deserved. He can open the densest philosophical
texts, ideas, and arguments. He can do it all on his own now, even if he
would say that he’s still really grateful that he will always have me
around to help him think through things when he hits a snag. I do not
really feel that he needs this anymore from me (again, invoking the
Nietzsche aphorism one last time, only the failed student never frees
herself from the thought of the teacher)—he needs no more help from me
on that front now, that’s for sure. Still, it is certainly true that it
is always good to have (conversational) partners in thinking.</p>
<p>What will William go on to do with this philosophical foundation that
he now possesses? Will he wander over into something like the philosophy
of mathematics? Or perhaps into something in the arena of the philosophy
of language? Or into metaphysics and ontology? Or into the realm of
aesthetics? I am not sure, although I do know that it will be something
incredibly special and unique. Now, it is true, I do have “a stake” of
sorts in William and his future—but not because he will just end up
being another feather in my cap—far from it! I have told him more times
than I can count—and no doubt the truthfulness of this was aided by the
fact that he and I were always playing within this “in between” space of
his “unofficial interests”—that I have a stake in him and his growth
because I have absolutely nothing that I want <em>from him</em>; I do,
on the contrary, have all kinds of things that I want <em>for him</em>,
in some deep and strong sense: I want him to be strong, autonomous,
free, sharp, driven, confident in his intellectual abilities and
capacities (which are, let me be honest, nothing short of incredibly
impressive). I want for him to be intense in his intellectual
engagements and sparring matches and in everything else that he will go
on to do in his life and his future. Do I want him to ultimately look
like me? Absolutely not. I want him to take what we have done
here—again, totally “unofficially”—and make something absolutely new and
strong and compelling and powerful. Countless times I have said to him:
“Please, please venture forth and make something new of all this stuff
we’ve been reading and talking about. Would I be fine with you going out
and making something of this crazy soup we’re cooking here that ends up
looking like what I would dislike? Absolutely … but don’t do that,” I
would always joke. I do have an investment in him, there’s no doubt
about that and I do want him to feel as confident about himself as I am.
Students like William just do not come around very often. I think that
he is going to be a real force in the future—and if I can figure out how
to have contributed to that in even the tiniest of ways, then there’s
absolutely nothing else that any teacher could ever want.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-remarks-on-teaching-as-a-whole">1.3 Concluding
Remarks on Teaching as a Whole</h2>
<p>Looking back on all I have written for this section, I can imagine
some rejoinders: how insane, how mad, to take five years’ worth of
teaching and speak about two, <em>only two</em>, students. It’s absurd;
it’s that simple—and everything in this reflection about these two
students can’t be anything but pure exaggeration. If I am being totally
honest, I am quite sympathetic to such a response. The sheer number of
words I’ve devoted to them (and the infinite number of thoughts I have
had about them both all throughout their academic journeys here at USF)
does suggest a profound intellectual closeness—perhaps a frightening
proximity, even, that is simply just not supposed to happen in the
academy; isn’t all of this writing here just indicative of an
all-too-excessive and unruly passion for a teacher’s two most favorite
students? Isn’t this kind of profound passion and love for one’s
students something that really—again, let’s be totally honest here—has
no place in our industry when we think of ourselves as
“professionals”?</p>
<p>I cannot help but return to a work that I cited as an epigraph in my
“Reflection” on MaKenzie’s project from bell
hooks.<label for="sn-146" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-146" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="146" class="sidenote"><em>Op. cit.</em>, p. 1.</span> hooks writes
about this kind of “passion” that is not to be shown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When eros is present in the classroom setting, then love is bound to
flourish. Well-learned distinctions between public and private make us
believe that love has no place in the classroom. Even though many
viewers would applaud a movie like <em>The Dead Poets Society</em>,
possibly identifying with the passion of the professor and his students,
rarely is such passion institutionally affirmed. Professors are expected
to publish, but no one really expects or demands of us that we really
care about teaching in uniquely passionate and different ways. Teachers
who love students and are loved by them are still “suspect” in the
academy. Some of the suspicion is that the presence of feelings, of
passions, may not allow for objective consideration of each student’s
merit. But this very notion is based on the false assumption that
education is neutral, that there is some “even” emotional ground we
stand on that enables us to treat everyone equally, dispassionately. In
reality, special bonds between professors and students have always
existed, but traditionally they have been exclusive rather than
inclusive. To allow one’s feeling of care and will to nurture particular
individuals in the classroom—to expand and embrace everyone—goes against
the notion of privatized
passion.<label for="sn-145" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-145" class="margin-toggle"/><span

</blockquote>
<p>I think that, in so many ways, the reigning ideology of
teachers-as-professionals still finds “something suspect” about
“[t]eachers who love students and are loved by them.” I am a little bit
loathe to write what I am about to here, but I feel some strong sense of
urgency and need to do so. I have painted a picture above of myself as
constantly running support for my two most loved students; constantly
keeping them and their goals and their desires and dreams always at the
forefront of my mind over the past two years. That is true. But I do
need to confess that this is only half of the equation, perhaps. Despite
the fact that MaKenzie may always edge out William slightly in terms of
being my most favorite and most loved student, there is no doubt that
these two are brilliant—absolutely phenomenal—intellectuals, thinkers,
readers, and
writers.<label for="sn-164" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-164" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="164" class="sidenote">It is only at this very moment, in just this
moment, that I wonder: are MaKenzie and William repetitions of one
another, or do they just merely “resemble” one another? I cannot even
begin to fathom how I have typed out as many words about them as I have
to create this reflection here and this connection is only now hitting
me so profoundly. I have already said how no two students are ever
really the same—yes, there are all kinds of ways in which they
“resemble” one another, but, as Deleuze notes so correctly, it is only
in the realm of repetition (and not in the realm of resemblance) that
something like the singularity of the other can be glimpsed.
Singularities <em>do not resemble one another</em>, but they do “repeat
each other” in a way that takes nothing away from that very singularity
and uniqueness (the <em>haecceity</em>, to borrow Scotus’ term, is
maintained only within the realm of repetition, not within the realm of
resemblances).</span> MaKenzie will have no peer, as I’ve said, and I
have the feeling that no student will ever come quite as close to
William in terms of ingenuity, sheer quantitative intellectual growth,
and significant philosophical sensitivity and prowess. But does this
really explain—if such a thing can even be explained, one should say—by
these two students’ abilities, capacities, and skills? On a good day, I
say yes—but I still have the nagging feeling that the other major part
of what was going on here was something else quite a bit different.</p>
<p>These two students wanted and needed something from me that I
actually had to give them. MaKenzie has said more times than I can even
mention that the greatest thing about our crossing paths was not that I
served as a wonderful teacher, advisor, and mentor to her; no, the
greatest thing was that I was a really great <em>friend</em> to her,
became one of the best friends she’d ever had (and there will never be a
day when this isn’t true—nor will there ever be a day when thinking
about this comment of hers that it doesn’t bring tears to my eyes). Did
the two of them want friendship and intellectual companionship from me?
Yes, I think so. It is true, too, that they wanted my intellectual
expertise—they wanted the knowledge that I have spent my entire adult
life chasing, corralling, and attaining. It might be that I am the
quintessential “odd one out,” but, prior to meeting MaKenzie, I had
never, ever had a student at all interested in this side of me. Before
William, I had never had a student who asked me, for example, what I
worked on as a scholar; I have never, ever had a student that actually
wanted all of this academic knowledge I have accrued over my career. I
would like to say that I have something of a track record of being a
good teacher; but all this knowledge (of philosophy, of literature, of
psychoanalysis, of Shakespeare, of Heidegger and Lacan and Derrida and
Foucault and everyone else)—no one has ever really seemed to have wanted
such things from me. I am aware, too, that one might say that this is
all completely and totally par for the course for a university like USF,
where the focus is so heavily placed on teaching, not on the other
areas. I know that our tenure policies tell us that these areas of
scholarship (in particular) and service are not to be short-changed; but
I have never seen a student also shared that sentiment and perspective.
I have never met a student for whom that registered at all on their
radar.</p>
<p>It is possible that this is all nothing more than a confession of a
profound lack and deficiency on my part. Have I chased opportunities to
share my own scholarly work with students? Absolutely. Have I hoarded my
real scholarly expertise, kept it hidden and locked away from students?
Never. But when William told me very early on in our relationship that
he sought me out because he saw on my profile on the USF website that I
worked in Post-Kantian philosophy, he was the very first student in my
entire teaching career that has ever said such a thing to me before. I
do not really say all of this to complain and gripe—it doesn’t
particularly bother me at all that students don’t really care about all
of the knowledge I’ve gathered in my career. Again, I understand, most
students do—I think—care about us in our roles as teachers, but I’ve
never found them to be all that considered with us as scholars. But
MaKenzie and William were different: they wanted that knowledge, craved
it incessantly, demanded it constantly with an enthusiastic hunger that
was absolutely unprecedented for me—and this hunger was so sublimely
beautiful, words fail me trying to describe it fully. (And, I should say
that even months after graduation, they still do: William comes multiple
times a week to continue talking philosophy and literature as he waits
to hear back from graduate schools; MaKenzie, as well, comes by after
work in the afternoons and uses her Fridays—her off-day each week—to
spend all day in the office working with me on our next essay project
together. (Indeed, she recently said that she was looking forward to
life after graduation because it would “give us a lot more time to
continue writing together.” Music to a teacher’s ear, that’s for
sure!)</p>
<p>I think it is probably the case that the fact that MaKenzie and I
ever met was just blind luck—pure chance. Still, I am so fortunate and
grateful that MaKenzie actually ended up coming my way. I would say that
she is one of those students who come around only once in a lifetime,
but that would not quite capture it—even if I lived a million lifetimes,
I am not quite certain I would have ever come across someone even
remotely like her. Students like her just never come around. As I think
back on and remember all the work I have done for and with MaKenzie, it
brings such a smile to my face to know that, if I am lucky, I will have
figured out some way to have contributed in just the tiniest way to all
the wonderful things that she will ultimately go on to do both in her
future. I will be so happy to be able to reflect back on that past from
some day “far north of the future,” as the German poet Paul Celan put it
in his <em>Atemwende</em>
(“Breathturn”),<label for="sn-147" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-147" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="147" class="sidenote">Paul Celan, <em>Selected Poems and Prose of
Paul Celan</em>, trans. John Felsteiner (New York: W. W. Norton &amp;
Co., 2001), p. 227.</span> and be so proud to be able to say that I was
“her teacher.”” Of course, when all is said and done, I am terribly
lucky that I didn’t really need to live a million lifetimes; in fact, I
only really needed one to find someone that I know I will be a friend
and co-author with for life (we’ll be “best buddies forever,” as she
often likes to say), no matter where her future travels take her.</p>
<p>And can my readers even imagine what it was like when William came my
way very soon after meeting MaKenzie? Can they imagine my shock and
surprise and pure bewilderment when I wondered aloud to myself
constantly in those early days, “Two of them? What are the odds?”
William has written—and I have already quoted it—about our first
meeting, “We said goodbye, and I walked away, in shock of the man I had
discovered by sheer luck and chance.” I am not so sure that it was just
luck and chance—as I say, he sought me out. Did he know what he was
getting when he found me? I’m not sure any of us can ever answer a
question (or one similarly posed) like that. My guess is that it’s quite
possible that he had some inkling, but, again, it probably wasn’t
crystal clear at the time. Was MaKenzie looking for me in a similar way?
I don’t think so. Though, again, upon our first meeting I would venture
to imagine that it’s possible we both immediately knew what we had each
found in the other. I was absolutely spoiled when MaKenzie and I found
one another; how much more infinitely spoiled when William’s initial
e-mail showed up in my inbox?</p>
<p>MaKenzie and William are each their own autonomous selves—they are
going to chart their own futures (I’ll be right by there side every step
of the way to help them out in any and every way I possibly can, of
course)—but it won’t surprise me when I see MaKenzie arguing cases
before the US Supreme Court. It won’t surprise me when I will read
William’s works of philosophy. It will be at those moments that I will
say—foregoing all of my humility (which both of them say is false
modesty on my part and in no way justified when it comes to my mentor-
and friendship of the pair of them)—that both she and he were (and are)
<em>my</em> students.</p>
<h1 id="scholarship">2. Scholarship</h1>
<p>It no doubt goes without saying, but when I think about my
scholarship over the years since I was granted tenure, the project with
MaKenzie I so exhaustively covered in <a href="#1-teaching">Section
1</a> above looms up into the foreground strongly. That said, I have
published frequently and often in the interim—my scholarly publication
record has thus been simultaneously brisk and sustained. I will plan to
canvas only the publications that do not include the most recent one
with MaKenzie.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-taken-so-far">2.1 The Road Taken So Far</h2>
<p>Starting in reverse chronological order:</p>
<p>1.) In 2018 I published “<em>L’extermination</em> <em>de tout
symbolisme des cieux</em>: Reading the Lacanian Letter as Inhuman
‘Apparatus’ and its Implications for Ecological
Thinking”<label for="sn-85" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-85" class="margin-toggle"/><span

Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), pp. 101-120.</span> and have been pleasantly
surprised by often this essay has been cited in the secondary literature
on Lacan, psychoanalysis, and environmental philosophizing more
generally (well, at least as far as <a
href="https://www.academia.edu/">academia.edu</a> is
concerned<label for="sn-84" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-84" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="84" class="sidenote">My review is available on the <em>Cider Press
Review: A Journal of Contemporary Poetry</em> <a
href="https://ciderpressreview.com/reviews/review-of-hallelujah-time-by-virginia-konchan/">here</a>.</span>).
This article went to press while the Tenure Committee was reviewing my
portfolio for tenure, so, technically, I should leave it aside here,
but, again, the ways in which this work has been taken up by other
scholars in my field pushes me just slightly to include it here.</p>
<p>2.) In 2019 Dean McDermott and I published a co-authored piece
together, “Poeticizing Ecology/Ecologizing Poetry: Reading Emily
Bishop’s ‘Poem’
Ecologically.”<label for="sn-86" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-86" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="86" class="sidenote"><em>Op. cit.</em> A full-text version of this
article is available <a
href="https://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/1569">here</a>.
The journal issue is dated from 2017 as <em>The Trumpeter</em> was a
little bit behind in their publication dates, thus the slightly
different publication and volume number years.</span> This was my first
stab ever at co-authorship and I enjoyed it immensely. It would no doubt
be really wonderful if I could spend a bit of time comparing and
contrasting the experience I had writing with Dean McDermott and the
very different one I had with MaKenzie—I would like to try to do that in
a somewhat slapdash way here now. I should say at the outset that I
found this whole endeavor to be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling—our
argument there is quite strong, it seems to me—but what I found most
fascinating about the whole thing was not so much about the “content” or
the finished product, instead, I couldn’t help but think—again, no
surprise here for me—about questions of “form” and “process” and
“procedure.” I was quite intrigued by the <em>very</em> different ways
that Dean McDermott and I seem to write. I think, once again, that when
someone says they have “written <em>with</em> another,” there is so much
to unpack with regards to this “with” and what that means and how it
works,
exactly.<label for="sn-87" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-87" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="87" class="sidenote">See this <a
href="#15-engl497-senior-thesis">Section</a> <em>supra</em> for more on
this “with” that I have already mentioned.</span> Dean McDermott and I
did write this article together, but the “with” felt to me to be
slightly more attenuated than the way it was with MaKenzie. Beth and I
did quite strongly divvy up our sections of that essay in the hopes of
having the sections speak most palpably to our respective skillsets: me
towards the philosophy and theory, Beth towards the close reading of
Emily Bishop’s “Poem.” With our respective sections completed, most of
the work was pretty much all done, all that was needed was the ligaments
to link them together in a way that felt seamless and not artificial. I
shouldn’t make it sound as if we didn’t talk about the things that each
of us were covering in our sections, but I don’t think that we had to do
as much “thinking <em>together</em>” compared to how much of this
MaKenzie and I did. Still, the article is rather strong and I was quite
pleased that Dean McDermott and I worked on this together.</p>
<p>3.) “Revolutionary Tenderness: Ecological Philosophy through
Continental and Catholic
Lenses”<label for="sn-88" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-88" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="88" class="sidenote"><em>AFCU Journal</em> Vol. 15, No. 1 (2019):

really sought to flesh-out all of the research work and study I started
a few years ago when I wanted to intervene in some of the
ecological/environmental concerns that were becoming increasingly more
and more prevalent within the humanities broadly construed. This article
allowed me to marshal a lot of old mainstays of my scholarly expertise
(Heidegger, in particular) while also getting that old knowledge to
articulate with a good deal of the new ecological thinking in general
(Morton plays a role here too, I should confess) I had acquired since
going up for tenure.</p>
<p>4.) My fourth article, entitled “The AI Computer as Therapist: Using
Lacan to Read AI and (All-Too-Human) Subjectivities in Science Fiction

Kritzer,”<label for="sn-90" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-90" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="90" class="sidenote"><em>Fafnir: Nordic Journal of Science Fiction

quite a fun one to write and compose. This grew out of an ENGL200 course
on Science Fiction where I had students read Naomi Kritzer’s wonderful
little story, “Cat Pictures

I perhaps had way too much fun working on this article—as I figured out
a way to combine a bunch of different interests of mine: science
fiction, Bruce Sterling, psychoanalysis and Lacan, and much more. As I
say, way too fun writing that one. Not only that, but this piece is one
I hope will properly lay a nice foundation for some future work having
to do with Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well.
(For more on this, see Section 2.3 <a
href="#23-future-research-interests-and-scholarship-plans">below</a>.)</p>
<p>5.) My last listed publication here was a review of Virginia
Konchan’s recent short work of poetry, <em>Hallelujah
Time</em>.<label for="sn-84" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-84" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="84" class="sidenote">My review is available on the <em>Cider Press
Review: A Journal of Contemporary Poetry</em> <a
href="https://ciderpressreview.com/reviews/review-of-hallelujah-time-by-virginia-konchan/">here</a>.</span>
This was also another incredibly fun little project to work on. One day
Dean McDermott came by to ask if I would be interested in us
collaborating again on something. I am not sure if many know, but Dean
McDermott is the current Editor-in-Chief there at <a
href="https://ciderpressreview.com/">Cider Press Review</a>. She
mentioned to me that a friend of hers, Virginia, had recently published
a short book of poetry. The poetry, she said, was heavily inflected with
all kinds of allusions to and resonances with “theory” in general; she
thus came my way thinking that this might be a wonderful little project
for us. I promised to have a read and let her know what I thought of it.
I might note here that Dean McDermott seems to know me pretty well; did
she know that I would absolute adore the book and become terribly
fascinated and intrigued by this wonderful little collection of poems (I
don’t know the answer to this query—I’ve yet to ask her)? We had a
wonderful conversation about the book—with me ceaselessly trying to
multiply and endlessly proliferate all the resonances and echoes,
constantly adding to the multiplicity of echoes of theoretical works and
ideas that I was finding in Virginia’s poems. Dean McDermott, in a
moment of really wonderful humility (well, at least, I would like to
parse it as humble), suggested that I go ahead and write the review
myself while she would handle the editing of the review. (Again, I could
imagine all kinds of other scholars who might have been so happy to just
pad their CVs with another publication—it’s difficult, impossible even,
for me to think of Dean McDermott rolling this way, but, once more, this
should do nothing to lessen how much humility it takes for a scholar to
say, “You go ahead and write it, I’ll edit it.” This kind of thing is,
I’ve found, exceedingly rare in our field and industry.) I cannot even
begin to say how much fun I had writing this review. Even on a first
cursory read, the allusions to other poetical (and theoretical texts)
within this short book of poems were legion for me. The first poem, “Bel
Canto,” is deeply indebted both to Nietzsche and also to Ovid’s infamous
story of
“Io”;<label for="sn-92" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-92" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="92" class="sidenote">See Book I of his <em>Metamorphoses</em> for
this story.</span> the second poem, “Joyride,” has a clear allusion to
Shakespeare’s <em>Richard
III</em>;<label for="sn-93" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-93" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="93" class="sidenote">This poem strongly and directly hearkens back
to that infamous line, “My kingdom for a horse,” from V.iv.</span> the
fourth poem gives shoutouts to both St. Paul and the work of George
Bataille on “general
economy”;<label for="sn-94" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-94" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="94" class="sidenote">Bataille’s clearest treatment of this concept
is in his first of three volumes: <em>The Accursed Share: An Essay on
General Economy</em> (New York: Zone Books, 1991).</span> the ninth poem
references <em>Hamlet</em>, again, very clearly; the thirteenth poem
goes all the way back to Plato; fourteen gives us some Wordsworth. It
was difficult—but only the good and healthy kind of “difficulty” is
meant here … the kind of difficulty that pushes and stretches one in
their thinking; yes, it can be painful, but it’s good to stretch and
push ourselves constantly—to figure how to think about possibly
corralling all of this multiplicity. I am absolutely certain that no one
will be surprised by what I am about to say, but the thing that really
helped me figure out how I wanted to think about all of this (and thus
write the review) was due to the almost daily presence of MaKenzie in my
office. While thinking through this book of poems, I had hit a bit of a
wall trying to wrangle things; at the time, MaKenzie and I were just
beginning to work through some of Nietzsche’s work very, very slowly and
carefully (I’ve already mentioned how significant this thinker
ultimately became for her). One day, we were finishing up talking about
Nietzsche’s early work, <em>On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History
for
Life</em>,<label for="sn-95" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-95" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="95" class="sidenote">See the edition translated by Peter Preuss
(Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 1980).</span> and were
about to transition over to a discussion of his masterpiece, <em>On the
Genealogy of
Morality</em>.<label for="sn-96" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-96" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="96" class="sidenote"><em>On the Genealogy of Morality</em>,
ed. Keith Ansell-Pearson, trans. Carol Diethe (Cambridge: Cambridge UP,
2007).</span> (This was still “early days” for us in our relationship
together; we were still getting to learn more and more about one
another’s thinking each and every day.) In the intervening week,
MaKenzie had spent a few days wrestling with yet another text by
Nietzsche that she grew to love immensely, <em>Human, All Too
Human</em>.<label for="sn-97" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-97" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="97" class="sidenote">(Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1986).</span> On this
day we got to chatting about the Nietzsche’s infamous use of the
“aphorism”—the short little paragraph or few sentences that manages to
pack into it an enormous, enormous, enormous multiplicity of sense and
meaning. MaKenzie noted how so many of the the titles in <em>Human</em>
are composed of these wonderful little morsels: “Chemistry of concepts
and sensations,” “Intoxicated by the scent of blossoms,” “Art is
dangerous for the artist,” “Making Smaller.” Asking her how she thought
they worked, she said that the chapter headings—as I put it in my
review—“serve as bookends of a sort for what occurs within the meat of
the aphorism.” As she has done for me time and time and time again,
MaKenzie gave me the little tweak in my thinking that got everything
moving. (I was so grateful that Dean McDermott allowed me to keep the
footnote in the review where I give all credit to MaKenzie for this
fundamental metaphor of the bookend—once more, I take no credit for
this; all the credit is due to
her.<label for="sn-98" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-98" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="98" class="sidenote">I would often joke with MaKenzie—especially
after we came across the CFP for Dr. Ashman’ edited collection and
decided we should take a shot at writing something for it—that the whole
task of co-authoring the paper with her was so that we could pull her
name from out of the footnotes at the bottom of the page in my work and
put it right at the top, as a fully-fledged author. Things have
conspired to make this ribbing not quite ribbing anymore at all. I
thought the footnote itself hardly skimped on praise for my student,
reading, as it does: “… moreover, [the reviewer] thanks her [MaKenzie]
for being the impetus for turning to Nietzsche’s philosophy as a way to
think through and properly describe what Konchan’s poems are up to and
ultimately what they are doing and effecting.” I am not quite sure I
could have figured this out without her input—still, it’s so much nicer
to have worked so hard to, indeed, pull her name up out of the footnote
and put it right at the very top.</span>) There’s little doubt in mind
the review would have suffered had it not been for MaKenzie’s presence
as impetus and drive.[^168] Looking back on the review, I notice all
kinds of philosophers influencing and playing a huge role in this short
little review: Deleuze in his solo-work makes an appearance, Deleuze and
Guattari show up, Melanie Klein gets a mention, even Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick as
well.<label for="sn-99" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-99" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="99" class="sidenote">“Memoriae Aeternae” clearly has an allusion to
Sedgwick, Judith Butler, et. al.: “So what if subjectivity is reducible
/ to performance, performance / to narrative, narrative to anecdote”
(p. 35). I know I don’t really need to gush any more about MaKenzie’s
thinking here in this reflection, but she even had a wonderfully
fantastic and beautiful “hot take” on the way the line break is working
in that last cited line. Brilliant stuff from her, as always.</span> All
of these thinkers are ones whose arguments MaKenzie and I rehearsed over
and over
again.<label for="sn-100" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-100" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="100" class="sidenote">Again, it’s terribly curious to me here in
terms of how really, genuinely, sincerely, and authentically MaKenzie
has influenced my thinking. My training is, admittedly, in 20th Century
French Continental thinking, but the likes of Deleuze and Guattari (just
to take the simplest and clearest example) is nowhere in my early work.
That early work was focused on the likes of Heidegger, Lacan, and
Derrida—Deleuze and Guattari were nowhere in that early part of my
career. Once again, the task of helping MaKenzie to learn as much as she
possibly could about these thinkers pushed me to re-travel paths that I
had travelled long before but never quite figured out to “put to
work.”</span> As I say, I am quite proud of this very short piece and am
so happy to see—again, upon another reading—the traces of profound
influence that working with MaKenzie produced (and continues to produce)
on my own philosophical/theoretical thinking and writing. I am also
quite hopeful that Dean McDermott might pass another text my way again
so I can take another shot at this genre that is (still) quite new to
me—i.e. the genre of the short review.</p>

<p>I am not quite certain under which category this best fits—it could
easily find a home in the “Service” <a href="#3-service">section</a>; it
could just as well go back in the <a href="#1-teaching">“Teaching”</a>

id="110" class="sidenote">Actually, this all sounds to me like
“Professional Development,” so maybe “Scholarship” is the perfect place
to put it.</span> I would like to talk about the part of the past few
years that saw me learning how to code and my initial journeys into the
realm of computer programming. I have tried to somewhat extensively
chronicle this path on my <a
href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/">blog</a>, but would like to
talk through it here as well.</p>
<p>I would like to lay out my journey of how I came to fall in love with
computational/digital study and why I cannot really imagine my
non-programming life before learning about the computer programming
world; I also can’t quite imagine that pre-computer science world to be
one I would ever want to return to, frankly. The story starts a couple
of years ago when the acting Provost at the time—Dr. Frank Pascoe—called
for those of us working within the humanities to think about potential
new
programs.<label for="sn-104" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-104" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="104" class="sidenote">The very idea of something like this was
probably the brain-child more of Anna than of me.</span> Dr. Pascoe was
extremely supportive of an initiative—spearheaded by myself and Dr. Anna
Ioanes—to put together a Digital Humanities (hereafter DIGH) degree. As
many may know, the field of DH has made wonderful headway into our
arena, but, still, it is headway made mostly at the graduate level.
Institutions that offer B.A. degrees in the Digital Humanities are still
few and far between (although we all no doubt know that the future may
be one where such a degree becomes a staple at every institution of
higher learning). As I hope many might already know, Anna came to USF
with a background in Digital Rhetoric and Composition, Digital Media
Studies, and other similar areas; she was thus quite naturally drawn to
this project for reasons that had much to do with the “design” side of
Digital Humanities (DH). I, myself, am always on the lookout for new
things to learn—and so I gravitated to slightly different areas within
this field than my colleague. Wanting to diversify between the two of
us, I have spent a great deal of time learning the more statistical and
computational side of things—focusing on learning to code in Python,
working on pet projects utilizing Natural Language Processing, data
visualization, sentiment analysis of social media platforms, machine
learning (to a tiny degree so far), with brief forays into work
currently being done through the <a href="https://tei-c.org/">Text
Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI), and much more.</p>
<p>Of course, it is true that this isn’t completely and totally foreign
to my academic background. I had taken a course in Java an eternity ago
when I was an undergraduate student (none of it stuck,
unfortunately—well, a little bit of it did stick, but not much) and I
took a slew of courses in mathematics also as an undergraduate (my
linear algebra knowledge stuck better, for some reason, than the Java
did). Speaking more directly to the idea of what the future might look
like in terms of digital coding and literacy, I myself became something
of a textbook case of this learning in action. As mentioned in the
previous paragraph, the past couple of years have seen me acquire a
large knowledge base of skills and abilities connected to this area:
knowledge of Python and SQL and Go and Lua, great familiarity with the
usual data formats (XML, JSON, CSV), standard data cleaning functions to
work with text-heavy datasets (with frequent use of the <a
href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas library</a>), numerous data
visualization techniques utilizing standard Python libraries like <a
href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> and <a
href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a>, all kinds of various algorithms
devoted to Topic Modeling, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine
Learning (ML) broadly speaking and much, much more. I should also note
that all this new learning has included a really healthy and robust use
of writing in <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com">Markdown</a>—I
write everything in that format now and cannot ever imagine going back
to the days of Microsoft Word and Google Docs (although, to be sure, I
still utilize those platforms when necessary). A knowledge of <a
href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, coupled with the wonderful
citation manager <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> has
greatly streamlined my workflow for academic writing and publishing.
Gone are the days of having to manually change the citation style in
order to tailor an essay for ten different journals—now I just write a
Python script to automate it all for me—what a huge difference that has
made. Just getting a small amount of knowledge such that I know what I’m
looking at when I get “under the hood,” so to speak, has been
monumentally impactful for me.</p>
<p>I also think that I have taken up a rather confident position, a
position that argues that just this (admittedly rather) basic knowledge
of software and script-writing within the field of the Digital
Humanities seems to me to be an absolute requirement for students within
the humanities more broadly. We often assume that all of our students
are highly literate when it comes to working within a digital ecosystem,
but the range of abilities and knowledge is incredibly varied and
wide-ranging. Every once in a while I will come across a student who has
not yet learned how to center a header in Word, for example—I have never
come across students with just enough programming knowledge to greatly
speed-up and automate their composition processes. As already noted, I
cannot imagine what life would be like without such knowledge, which,
again, is quite small—it’s nowhere close to what people with Computer
Science degrees know, but even just a tiny bit of knowledge is huge.
Undoubtedly, I have, in so many ways, just scratched the surface here
and I cannot even begin to say how excited I am to continue learning as
much about the “Data Science” field as I possibly can. I can see the
power and significance of all this—even from that barely-scratched
surface and have greatly enjoyed thinking infinitely about all of the
consequences and implications it all has for future study of and within
the humanities in particular—and I can easily see many of the
consequences and ramifications of how this might all be put into
practice.</p>
<p>In order to provide some slightly more “concrete” examples of all
this learning “put into practice,” I’d like to try to do that now. I
run, every semester, an extremely well-received Gen Ed course on
literature centered around what many call “Weird Fiction” (a genre that
includes the likes of M. R. James, Lovecraft, Stephen King, and many
more). The course structure and pedagogical ethos is quite simple to
describe. We have one main text, a large anthology called <em>The Weird:
A Compendium of Strange and Dark
Stories</em><label for="sn-106" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-106" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="106" class="sidenote">Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer (New York:
Tom Doherty Associates Book, 2011).</span>—I’ve carved up the book into
chunks, each week students have roughly ten or so stories that they can
pick to read. They choose which ones and then are asked to compose
write-ups and analyses of their three picks, along with a response to a
fellow student’s post. (As is par for the course here, student autonomy
and freedom is the absolute name of the game). I put no limits on
student posts in terms of word counts. I have been really pleasantly
surprised to notice that when I do not explicitly give students limits,
they have something of a tendency to write and write and write. (Of
course, I haven’t really tried the opposite setup—i.e. explicitly giving
students a word count limit to hit, but, of course, I would imagine many
other faculty do this kind of thing: do students in their courses often
write <em>more</em> than is explicitly required of them? If they did, I
think I would find that to be rather surprising.) Obviously, there is an
easy to measure/visualize
this.<label for="sn-109" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-109" class="margin-toggle"/><span

<p><img
src="5_supporting_materials/c_code/ii_images/a_weird_fiction_work/word_count_plots.png" /></p>
<p>I refined a rather extensive technique of student feedback given each
week in response to work they do on our Canvas discussion boards. After
learning a bit of Markdown and wanting to be able to work on providing
this feedback by first working offline, I set myself a very simple task
of learning how to work with <a
href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">Instructure’s
API</a> (through a wonderful little open source Python module called <a
href="https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">CanvasApi</a>)
so that I could compose all of my weekly responses to students in a
simple plain text file (the work of <a
href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">Dennis
Tenen</a> on plain text composition [this was also something of an
impetus to get working with and within Markdown] was incredibly
influential on me) and then fully automate the uploading of said
comments along with grades for each assignment through a simple Python
script.<label for="sn-105" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-105" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="105" class="sidenote">If readers are curious about what this
workflow looks like now, where I create a simple .json file that
contains all of the comments and grades for each student, please see my
blog post on this <a
href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-01-13-canvas-live-api-work/">here</a>.</span>
A huge part of this course is based on this faculty feedback—and being
able to not have to worry so much about the technical sides of things
obviously frees one (and their time) up for all kinds of other
wonderful, far more profoundly significant pedagogical concerns. As
Robby Burns <a
href="https://www.robbyburns.com/blog/eliminating-canvas-stress-by-writing-content-in-markdown">mentions</a>,
“You go to war with the LMS you have”—obviously, if we ourselves can
spend less time going to war with the LMS we have, this is almost always
a good thing. And, to be honest, I wonder if the only real way to avoid
having to fight the LMS is by having access to and learning about how
our digital infrastructure really works. As proponents and advocates of
open-source software love to say, being able to get “under the hood,” so
to speak, of our digital software while having some sense of what one’s
looking at once one gets the hood open, provides one with infinite
possibilities. Prior to putting together this Digital Humanities
program, prior to learning how to code and write simple Python scripts,
I was so often at war with the LMS; today, I fight the LMS quite far
less: now I head for the documentation and solve problems myself with a
degree of autonomy that I didn’t really even know was possible. Now even
much more mundane tasks—for example, like structuring one’s Department’s
Assessment data (making sure one has all the metadata they need in the
right spots with all the scripts pulling from one centralized location,
etc.) so that annual reports become so much smoother to create—is just
icing on the cake. It is nice to be able to write scripts to generate,
say, network graphs of my students’ discussion posts—who’s responding to
whom, which author/story got talked about the most often each week—and
it is quite awesome to be able to write a script to keep track of all of
this data spread out over the entire history of the course—a little data
wrangling and munging and I can track everything from the length of
student posts to how many times (over the past four years or so) the
vast majority of students wrote incessantly about a Clive Barker story
in Week 14 of the semester.</p>
<p>Actually, if readers are curious about what some of these “network”
visualizations might look like, I could provide a slight timeline here
showing all of the results that I worked on
iteratively.<label for="sn-107" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-107" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="107" class="sidenote">Again, on my blog this journey is covered <a
href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/">here</a>
and <a
href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-20-visualizing-discussion-boards-redux_23/">here</a>—but
I’m collapsing them both together here.</span> When I first started out,
wanting to simply keep track of which authors students were reading each
week, I took an angle that I know computer programmers would sigh and
roll their eyes at (fully justified is this response, I should say). I
did it manually. As I responded and graded each post, I kept track of
which authors were mentioned. Again, a perfectly fine way to do it, but
perhaps not all that sustainable. An initial stab for this came in the
form of simple attempts to draw the network graphs in Word:</p>

src="5_supporting_materials/c_code/ii_images/a_weird_fiction_work/iteration_1.png"
alt="first_iteration" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">first_iteration</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My second iteration simply switched out the program I used to produce
the visualization—instead of Word, I switched over to <a
href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>—which also made it easy for one to
alter the sizes of the nodes (and also the colors of the lines); the
size of the node is based on its <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)#:~:text=In%20graph%20theory%2C%20the%20degree,two%20ends%20of%20the%20edge.">degree</a>;
the larger the node, the more frequently that author (or student) was
mentioned in a post:</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>This got me somewhat closer to where I wanted to ultimately be.
Recourse to Gephi was definitely helping out and there were even ways to
color code things based on the particular course and semester. Thus, if
I wanted to look at, say, five different incarnations of the course, I
could easily visualize the connections:</p>
<figure>
<img
src="5_supporting_materials/c_code/ii_images/a_weird_fiction_work/iteration_6.png"
alt="iteration_6" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">iteration_6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, the visualization part was getting better, but the gathering of
the data (the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling">“data wrangling”</a>
part) was still onerous. What were my options if I no longer wanted to
manually keep track of which authors students were writing about most
often each week (again, this part was largely superfluous—the goal of
reading student posts and responding to them was to do just that, not
keep track of the most frequently cited authors)? Ideally, it would be
nice to have some methods native to the Canvas Instructure LMS to
download all of the Discussion Board posts from a particular Canvas
course shell. Now, there is a way to do this, but I didn’t yet know how
to do this, so I ended up going in a different direction. It turns out
there are some user-developed scripts that will allow one to grab all of
the posts; the best Canvas Userscript for this purpose was (and is
still, I believe) available through <a
href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">TamperMonkey</a> <a
href="https://breid.host.dartmouth.edu/userscripts/">here</a>). Once one
runs this script while in the “Discussion Board” assignment area of
Canvas, one can get a .csv file that has all kinds of fantastic
information and data in it. So, at this point, one now has a list of all
student names along with the text of each of their posts. The next step
was then to write a function to read through all of the student posts
and then extract every time a student mentioned either one of the
authors of a piece or the title of that piece itself. This is simple
enough in the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> coding
language. It would look something like the following, assuming we had a
file that had a list of all the author names and story titles that we
wanted to search in the .csv file for:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># The first line reads in a list of author and story names, keyed with a unique ID for each one: this serves as the list of terms we&#39;re searching student posts for ...</span></span>

<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">return</span> authorMentions</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This way I could keep track of the author of the post (this is the
number in the “source” column where each student got a unique number
belonging to them) and also the names of the stories (these are listed
in the “target” column):</p>

<p>So, this would allow me to still produce a nice visualization (this
one above utilizes the <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly library</a>
within the Python ecosystem)—and it was, at this point, all being done
by the script/code, no more keeping track of things manually. This was
clearly an improvement over where I started. I began with a somewhat
simple desire/problem: I just wanted to make it easier to see which
authors in the anthology were the most popular—i.e. which ones students
mentioned most frequently, etc. Moreover, were these authors the same
ones from semester to semester, year to year? I was thus at a point
where answering questions like these became really simple: just pull the
data down from Canvas with the TamperMonkey script, feed it into the
Python code, and then plot. Easy-breezy.</p>
<p>The latest version hasn’t drastically changed things. I have given up
using the TamperMonkey script in preference of simply interacting
directly with <a
href="https://stfrancis.instructure.com/doc/api/live">Instructure’s own
API</a><label for="sn-108" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-108" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="108" class="sidenote">For a slightly more “philosophical” take on
this preference for working more “directly” with the API, feel free to
see my <a
href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-01-13-canvas-live-api-work/">post</a>
on this, especially the “Addendum #1, Tuesday, 17 January 2023” section
down towards the bottom.</span> while not going through the
“intermediary” that was the TamperMonkey in my original iterations. This
now ends up with something like the following, utilizing the well-known
<a href="https://bokeh.org/">“bokeh” library</a>:</p>

<embed
       type="text/html"
       src="5_supporting_materials/c_code/ii_images/a_weird_fiction_work/plot.html"
       width="1100"
       height="600"
       >
</embed>

<p>The above image should be interactive as well, you can drag and recenter the plot, even mousing over specific nodes gives a little bit of metadata about each point (this is a staple
of bokeh).</p>
<p>I should note that all of this is just barely scratching the surface
of all my newfound knowledge in this arena. A great many new skills were
acquired in order to solve very particular and specific problems. The
one above started with a pretty easy problem: how to keep track of the
most popular authors in a course with a lot of reading (this no doubt
arose precisely because I don’t explicitly mandate/require which authors
and stories students have to read—<em>they</em> get to pick and choose
each week, I don’t choose for them). I have also turned a good deal of
this knowledge and philosophy to (perhaps) even slightly more mundane
concerns like Departmental Assessment reports, keeping track of student
assessment data, and, also (and perhaps most importantly), learning to
not rely so much on “Excel” and to “let that piece of software
go.”<label for="sn-111" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-111" class="margin-toggle"/><span

href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-01-18-letting-excel-go_06/">this
way</a>.</span> All of this has opened-up a whole new territory for me
and the vistas are quite beautiful to look at, I think. As I mentioned
earlier, it’s hard to imagine what things would have been like had I not
come across all of this new knowledge and information—which is perhaps
the best definition for when learning and education are “actually
working” and “doing what they should be doing.”</p>
<h3 id="connections-with-the-classroom">2.2.1 Connections with the
Classroom</h3>
<p>I am not so certain that this is something that was brand-new after
acquiring all of this DH knowledge, but it is definitely a thing that
intensified a little bit after I came to learn more and more. This is
again easy to see at work in this previously discussed ENGL200: Weird
Fiction course I’ve talked about already. Repeating myself here, but I
had always given students a ton of freedom in terms of the kinds of work
that they wanted to do in the course (this was true long before any of
the DH knowledge came under my belt). The weekly discussion boards were
always required assignments and the course also always included a
“Mid-Term Project Proposal” along with a completed “Final Project.” The
“Project Proposal” that is due at Mid-Term time is quite wide-open,
greatly open-ended by design (a copy of the latest incarnation is
available <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12dmNsTmzQMihkqQdH6EpG8c4RsgIb71Z/view?usp=share_link">here</a>.)
Students get complete freedom and autonomy to design their own
projects—they get to determine how they will be assessed. As I hope we
all know, there are as many ways to show ones learning as there are
students on the planet. The “Proposal” thus asks students to think about
all kinds of things that are staples of good rhetorical thinking:
audience, purpose, length, process, the options are numerous.</p>
<p>I have pulled down from the <a
href="https://stfrancis.instructure.com/doc/api/live">USF Canvas
Instructure API</a> all the information about all of the different kinds
of projects that students have uploaded to the “Final Project” dropbox
for each time I’ve done the course. Here are some plots of the data:</p>

<p>As one can see, although it is true that the majority of students
have preferred to go the “Personal Reflection” route—and, I should note
that these are often glowing with praise about the course—it is also
true that students have taken some really rather creative routes to
showing and demonstrating what they have learned over the course of the
semester. (Even more curious, many of the reflections that a machine
learning library would classify as “negative” are due to the fact that
these assessments more often than not talk about how the course was “not
what they expected,” but ended up loving because of this fact; many of
the others also greatly contrasted this course and its ethos with
literature courses they took in the past and didn’t really like at
all.<label for="sn-113" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-113" class="margin-toggle"/><span

Machine Learning for Stylometry <em>re</em> Authorship Attribution</h4>
<p>I would like to return to a topic of discussion that I discussed
already when chronicling William’s work with me on Hemingway. In many of
those conversations, he would often draw parallels and comparisons
between Hemingway and Fitzgerald (we even read very closely one of my
most favorite Fitzgerald stories, “Babylon
Revisited”<label for="sn-149" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-149" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="149" class="sidenote">This short story can be found in F. Scott
Fitzgerald, <em>Babylon Revisited and Other Stories</em> (New York:
Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1973), pp. 210-30.</span>). I was curious—could
one, say, train a machine learning model to tell the difference between
a text written by Hemingway and one by Fitzgerald? For sure—and what I
still find so fascinating is that the way in which the models can do
this are not really all that “complex” or “complicated” or
“sophisticated”—at least, they are definitely not more sophisticated
than when a seasoned reader can (perhaps somewhat) intuitively tell the
difference immediately between Hemingway’s and Fitzgerald’s stylistic
tendencies. So let’s write a little Python code and I’ll try to take
readers through what’s going on along each step of the
process.<label for="sn-150" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-150" class="margin-toggle"/><span

<p>The first step is data gathering, so we head over to <a
href="https://gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg.org</a> to grab texts
that are available and in the public domain by both <a
href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/420">Fitzgerald</a> and <a

id="151" class="sidenote">Many of the works by Hemingway are not in the

perfect case of “Fair Use,” one can head over <a

way</a> for some of those Hemingway works.</span> Once we have some
texts that we can use to train and test the classifier models, we can
start coding. We will be utilizing one of the go-to machine learning
libraries within Python, <a
href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sci-kit learn</a>, an absolute
staple for those working in machine learning. Thus we start with our
import statements (we’re also using <a
href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a> and <a
href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> again for plotting, pandas
for data wrangling, etc. [the <code>load_data</code> function is just a
simple function to read in all the text files and keep track of the
author of each text]):</p>

<p>Next we call our <code>load data</code> function to load in all of
our text files and then convert that into a pandas DataFrame that
contains the text of the work (in the <code>text_data</code> column)
along with the named author in the <code>label</code> column. We also
want to let sklearn know which columns have the “text” and which one
contains the “real/true” labels for each text:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>text_data, labels <span class="op">=</span> load_data(<span class="st">&#39;data&#39;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>df <span class="op">=</span> pd.DataFrame(<span class="bu">list</span>(<span class="bu">zip</span>(text_data, labels)), columns<span class="op">=</span>[<span class="st">&#39;text_data&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;label&#39;</span>])</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>X <span class="op">=</span> df[<span class="st">&#39;text_data&#39;</span>]</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>y <span class="op">=</span> df[<span class="st">&#39;label&#39;</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we utilize one of the functions from the sklearn library that
takes the dataset and splits it into “training” and “testing” sets. The
training set will be the data that the model is given to “learn” what
makes a Hemingway text a Hemingway text (and similarly for Fitzgerald);
the “testing” data is just that: those are the texts that the model has
never seen before and thus will make predictions on/about. The normal
split in machine learning is usually 80% of the data used for training
and 20% for testing, but here we’re passing a percentage of 30%:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test <span class="op">=</span> train_test_split(X, y, test_size<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.3</span>, random_state<span class="op">=</span><span class="dv">42</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that the training and testing sets are split up, we can start to
transform all of this text data into what the model can understand,
namely, numbers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Create a bag-of-words representation of the text data</span></span>

<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>X_train_vec <span class="op">=</span> vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>X_test_vec <span class="op">=</span> vectorizer.transform(X_test)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What the <a
href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer"><code>CountVectorizer()</code></a>
function does is it takes all of the words in the text and converts the
whole text file into just a long list of words. (This is often called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">“bag of
words” representation</a> because all the program is doing is, quite
literally, counting each word and how many times each word appears;
everything ends up in a “bag” because this process disregards grammar
and also word order too.) The second and third lines of code just apply
this technique/function to both the training and testing sets—for more
information, the <code>.fit</code> method is explained in the
documentation <a
href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.fit">here</a>
and the <code>.fit_transform</code> <a
href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.fit_transform">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once the text files are converted into a matrix (i.e. the data has
been <a
href="https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-multinomial-naive-bayes-vectorization/">“vectorized”</a>),
one can then train a model to make predictions on the testing data. For
this little project, we’ll utilize a widely used algorithm that is based
on “Bayes’ theorem,” which “describes the probability of an event, based
on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the
event.”<label for="sn-152" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-152" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="152" class="sidenote">See Wikipedia’s entry on “Bayes Theorem” <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">here</a>. The
entry on the “Naive Bayes Classifier” is also available <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">here</a>.</span>
This is a very commonly used model for “text classification” problems
and it thus serves our purposes here well
enough.<label for="sn-153" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-153" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="153" class="sidenote">The implementation documentation for this in
sklearn is available <a
href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB">here</a>.</span>
Once the model is instantiated, we can fit it on our data as
follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>nb <span class="op">=</span> MultinomialNB()</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>nb.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So how accurate is the model on the texts that were set aside for the
testing purposes? One of the standard ways to see the accuracy of the
model is to use a number of metrics—i.e. “precision,” “recall,”
“f1-score,”
etc.<label for="sn-156" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-156" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="156" class="sidenote">Of course, one could utilize all the rich
information that would come from looking at the author’s grammatical
tics and preferences. A simple workflow for this would take the texts
and extract all of the “parts of speech” (POS) for each word in each
sentence (the <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy library</a> is a
fantastically awesome workhouse for this kind of thing); once one had
“POS tagged” each sentence, those counts—of nouns, verbs, participles,
direct objects (something of a big favorite of Hemingway, in
particular), even the number of punctuation marks—could be used in
further <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">“feature
engineering”</a> the model so that it could use those numbers to make
predictions. For readers that are interested in how some of the
different kinds of classifier handle trying to classify texts by all
three authors (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Steinbeck), the following <a
href="https://github.com/kspicer80/fitzgerald_hemingway/blob/main/grammatical_parsing_for_feature_generation.ipynb">Jupyter
notebook</a> has the code and results. (As a tiny teaser here: a
standard <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic
regression</a> model’s accuracy comes back at 50%, a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">“decision
tree” classifier</a> hit 83%, and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting">“gradient
boosting machine”</a> model hit perfect accuracy and was able to
correctly classify texts by all three authors.)</span> Sklearn has a
built-in function for this, <code>classification_report</code> which
quickly provides us with these metrics and scores. Below we’ll print out
the <code>accuracy_score</code> for the testing data along with the
other metrics:</p>

<p>These are fantastic scores for the model. Of course, there are also
nice and simple ways to visualize the predictions the model has made by
utilizing what is called a “confusion
matrix”.<label for="sn-157" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-157" class="margin-toggle"/><span

<p>A classifier with scores like these is considered to be performing
extremely well. But what if we wanted to kick the tires on this model
just a little bit more by passing it, say, a text by Hemingway that the
model has never before encountered, either in training or testing (many
machine learning modeling workflows include this as the “validation”
set, a sample to make a prediction on that was not in the training or
testing datasets)? Well, let’s feed this brand-new (to the model) text
and see who it predicts wrote it. We’ll ask it to make a prediction
about Hemingway’s “The Snows of Kilimanjaro.” Again, easy enough—and the
steps are the same (we read in the text file, vectorize it, and then
pass it to the model to make a prediction):</p>

<p>Nice—a perfectly correct prediction. I should say that one could
easily wonder just a bit if the binary parameter here in this problem—a
text is either by Hemingway or it’s not—does come with some starting
assumptions that one could tweak slightly if they wanted. What if the
comparison was not between Hemingway and Fitzgerald but between
Hemingway and someone a reader might consider to already be somewhat
“closer” to Hemingway in terms of style? What about texts by John
Steinbeck? Again, we can reuse the code already and simply alter it so
that we have the program read in the texts by Steinbeck in the training
part of the process. Once again, a very simple Naive Bayes classifier
can quite easily distinguish between Hemingway and Steinbeck too:</p>

<p>And, once more, if we pass it a text by Steinbeck (<em>In Dubious
Battle</em>) for validation, we can ask for another prediction—and we
get:</p>
<p><img

<p>What I find so fascinating about this entire process is what I
mentioned earlier, the model can seem to figure out who authored what
simply by counting words and keeping track of their frequencies—nothing
more sophisticated would seem to be required here. There are, of course,
far more intricate algorithms and vectorizers that can be used when
working with textual data (the “term-frequency inverse document
frequency,” TF-IDF for short, is just one example), but such
sophistication seems unnecessary—at least here in this particular case.
The frequency counts of words seem to be enough to distinguish between
the writing of these
authors.<label for="sn-156" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-156" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="156" class="sidenote">Of course, one could utilize all the rich
information that would come from looking at the author’s grammatical
tics and preferences. A simple workflow for this would take the texts
and extract all of the “parts of speech” (POS) for each word in each
sentence (the <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy library</a> is a
fantastically awesome workhouse for this kind of thing); once one had
“POS tagged” each sentence, those counts—of nouns, verbs, participles,
direct objects (something of a big favorite of Hemingway, in
particular), even the number of punctuation marks—could be used in
further <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">“feature
engineering”</a> the model so that it could use those numbers to make
predictions. For readers that are interested in how some of the
different kinds of classifier handle trying to classify texts by all
three authors (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Steinbeck), the following <a
href="https://github.com/kspicer80/fitzgerald_hemingway/blob/main/grammatical_parsing_for_feature_generation.ipynb">Jupyter
notebook</a> has the code and results. (As a tiny teaser here: a
standard <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic
regression</a> model’s accuracy comes back at 50%, a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">“decision
tree” classifier</a> hit 83%, and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting">“gradient
boosting machine”</a> model hit perfect accuracy and was able to
correctly classify texts by all three authors.)</span> It might perhaps
go without saying, but I think these developments ask those of us
working within the humanities to potentially rethink how we want to talk
about something like a writer’s “style.” Those working in literature
might love to use all kinds of literary techniques, rhetorical tropes,
and much more to discuss a writer’s style. The machine would seem to be
able to get along just fine by merely(?) counting things. As I say, I
think this is incredibly thought-provoking for humanistic study more
broadly.</p>
<h4 id="nlp-and-metaphor-detection">2.2.2.2 NLP and Metaphor
Detection</h4>
<p>In the previous section I mentioned “literary techniques” that the
machine learning models might seem to be able to largely dispense
with—at least when it comes to trying to determine if a text was created
by Hemingway or Fitzgerald or Steinbeck. What if one wanted to play
around a little bit while directly thinking about, say, one of those key
“literary techniques” that we all associate with literature and
fictional texts in general—namely, metaphor? This is a quite fascinating
arena of study: how to get a machine to understand something like a
metaphorical use of a word, of language. A good deal of work here has
been in data annotation and data labeling, that is, the manual (by a
human) tagging of datasets for the presence of a metaphor. The largest
corpus for this kind of thing appears to be the one created and made
available by the <a
href="http://www.vismet.org/metcor/documentation/home.html">“VU
Amsterdam Metaphor”</a> project, which offers “about 190,000 lexical
units from a subset of four broad registers … academic texts,
conversation, fiction, and news texts.” Of course, one of the major
websites that offer open source access to labeled datasets and machine
learning models is <a
href="https://huggingface.co/">huggingface.co</a>—and there is even a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">transformer</a>
model that has already been trained on the Amsterdam labeled dataset
that can be freely accessed <a
href="https://huggingface.co/lwachowiak/Metaphor-Detection-XLMR">here</a>.
What would we discover if we tried out this model on some fictional
stories that we ourselves tagged and labeled? As one might guess
already, William was more than willing to do some data annotation
(“hand-labeling,” so to speak) with me.</p>
<p>Still sticking with our Fitzgerald-Hemingway corpus of texts, we
picked out a couple of texts that we would each
label.<label for="sn-154" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-154" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="154" class="sidenote">The code for this can be found in the same <a
href="https://github.com/kspicer80/fitzgerald_hemingway">“fitzgerald_hemingway”
repo</a> already cited.</span> I wrote some code to carve up each
sentence in Fitzgerald’s “Babylon Revisited” along with a couple of
other stories by Hemingway. The code got us a nice <code>.jsonl</code>
file that had fields for the “annotator,” the “sentence_number,” the
“text” of the sentence, and then a “label.” Sentences that we parsed as
“literal” got an “l”; sentences with a metaphor in them got tagged with
an “m.”</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">babylon_revisited_jsonl_file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, before I even get to how the model tagged the sentences, William
and I found ourselves talking a lot about the rather starkly different
ways in which we each thought about literality and metaphor in general.
Some quick parsing of each of our annotations show something of a
divergence in the way we labeled metaphorical and figurative language in
this story by Fitzgerald:</p>
<figure>

alt="label_comparison_between_w_and_dr_s" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">label_comparison_between_w_and_dr_s</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It thus appears that I had a tendency to want to parse more sentences
as “metaphorical” than did William. If we were really doing this “for
real,” William and I would have perhaps spent more time before engaging
in this exercise norming our annotations—trying to see if we could get
“on the same page” about how we wanted to tag things. That said, we did
do a little bit of this somewhat informally as we picked out a number of
sentences where our labels didn’t match. We also took a gander at some
sentences that gave both William and I some trouble—sentences, for
example, that we could have tagged as “metaphorical” but ended giving a
“literal” label. One in particular is sentence number 52, which reads:
“Outside, the fire-red, gas-blue, ghost-green signs shone smokily
through the tranquil rain.” I annotated this one as possessing a
metaphor (my metric here was pretty simple: if the sentence said
something that wasn’t literally true, it got a “metaphor” label)—ghosts
don’t exist (or so I think) and thus one couldn’t describe something
that didn’t literally exist as green (or as anything else for that
matter, frankly). William also parsed it as “metaphorical,” but admitted
that there was a way in which the parallelism of hyphenated terms in the
sentence could allow one to, arguably, read it as literal: fire can be
red, gas can be blue, a green sign can be “<em>ectoplasmically</em>
green,” in some sense. Of course, this sentence is quite a beautiful
one: all the terms that are first in the hyphens (“fire,” “gas,” and
“ghost”) give one the sense of these colors perceived wispily (thus the
“ghost”) through the rain in Paris. On the other hand, the terms that
follow the hyphens (“red,” “blue”, “green”) all point to explicit,
literal, colors. As I say, it’s a gorgeously balanced sentence in its
syntactic form and semantic resonances.</p>
<p>Now, the intriguing question: how did the model label the
sentences—and how did those tags compare/contrast to the labels William
and I gave to the data?</p>

<p>Fascinatingly, the model tagged far more sentences as metaphorical
than did William or I. How did it parse that sentence number 52? The
model outputs the following:</p>

<p>The model returns a list of dictionaries containing the following: a
label (“LABEL_0” for a word used literally and “LABEL_1” for one being
used metaphorically), a score containing a likelihood/confidence for
that label, the words that are being tagged as literal or metaphorical,
where the word or phrase starts and ends (with the index starting at 0
and then running to the last word in the sentence). Very curiously—and
seemingly identical to my own rationale for tagging this sentence as
“metaphorical”—the model highlights the “ghost” adjective as the real
culprit here, all the rest of the sentence gets labeled as strictly
literal in nature. (I should also perhaps note here that if the model
returned at least one “LABEL_1” for a word or group of words in the
sentence, that ultimately got entered into the database as
“metaphorical”—one could, however, imagine slightly better ways to
determine if the sentence is metaphorical, perhaps some kind of
threshold where we set the condition as something like: “If the returned
list of dictionaries has two or more LABEL_1 tags, then the sentence is
a metaphor.”)</p>
<p>Some of the differences between our labels and the model’s seem easy
enough to understand. For example, the ninth sentence has the narrator
ask the head hotel concierge if he has seen George Hardt recently, whom
the narrator describes as being a “Snow Bird” (one that travels and
migrates from Paris to elsewhere according to the seasons). The model
returns this as purely literal:</p>

<p>This one is quite curious—I labeled it as literal, though I could
easily imagine that use of the economic term (which is, admittedly and
after all, a <em>metaphor</em>), “bull market,” should mean the sentence
gets a “metaphor” label (or the adjective “head” to modify “barman”
would be enough to mark it as metaphorical). That said, it’s curious how
the model picks out the “with” and “in” words as ones leading to a
metaphorical classification. Again, this is quite odd and further
investigation should be able to say a little bit more about what’s going
on here. (I haven’t yet had a chance to dig into this, but definitely
will here in the near future.)</p>
<p>One last example here. There is a scene that occurs between the
narrator and his daughter, Honoria, from whom the former has been
estranged. A very key moment occurs when the two of them go out to
dinner together after much time spent apart (Honoria has been living
with her aunt and uncle there in Paris):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there had been her mother and a French nurse he had been
inclined to be strict; now he extended himself, reached out for a new
tolerance; he must be both parents to her and not shut any of her out of
communication.<br />
“I want to get to know you,” he said gravely. “First let me introduce
myself. My name is Charles J. Wales, of Prague.”<br />
“Oh, daddy!” her voice cracked with laughter.<br />
“And who are you, please?” he persisted, and she accepted a role
immediately: “Honoria Wales, Rue Palatine, Paris.”<br />
“Married or single?”<br />
“No, not married. Single.”<br />
He indicated the doll. “But I see you have a child, madame.”<br />
Unwilling to disinherit it, she took it to her heart and thought
quickly: “Yes, I’ve been married, but I’m not married now. My husband is
dead.”<br />
He went on quickly, “And the child’s name?”<br />
“Simone. That’s after my best friend at school.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very beautiful moment where the estranged father and
daughter play a little game, engage in a tiny little theatrical
drama—and on multiple levels: they pretend that they don’t know each
other (which is, admittedly, something that does have the ring of truth
given how they have been separated); the narrator pretends that he is
“Charles J. Wales, of Prague” (this also has a certain tint of truth to
it—the narrator’s name is Charlie and he does plan to hopefully take
Honoria to Prague to live with him when he leaves Paris); then,
extending the playacting even further, Honoria herself dives right into
the game, manufacturing a fictional persona where she is married
(there’s a third level if we want to add the aspect concerning her doll
as her own “child”)—or, <em>was</em> married, we should note (the
narrator’s wife and Honoria’s mother is, in the “reality” of the story,
herself dead). Human annotators would want to label this entire
conversation and exchange as deeply metaphorical (or, perhaps, deeply
“figurative” or “fictional” in tone). How would the model handle
this?</p>
<figure>
<img
src="5_supporting_materials/c_code/ii_images/c_metaphor_detection/doll_drama.png"
alt="doll_drama_exchange" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">doll_drama_exchange</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One could imagine some reasons why the model might tag some of the
sentences here as metaphors. Sentence 172 seems fine—voices can’t
“crack”; sentence 179 mentions how Honoria “takes the doll to her heart”
and the model parses “heart” here as functioning as a metaphor (fair
enough, one supposes); but the sentences where Honoria assumes a
fictional persona (especially sentences 174-176) are labeled as purely
literal. Okay, maybe, but in the context of the story (and not at the
level of the word or token), I think most human annotators will use
their intuition here and label them as profoundly metaphorical—or
perhaps “allegorical,” which would be enough for me to mark them as
quite metaphorical or “figurative’” in nature.</p>
<p>One wonders, though, what else would the machine need to ” know” in
order to know that Honoria can’t have been (literally) married and thus
these lines would need to be read as not at all literal? And, once one
knew such data points, could one also incorporate said data into the
model’s learning? I could imagine some tagging of the text that might
include all kinds of “metadata” about the characters in the text. As a
simple toy model example, one could envision using some of NLP
techniques around <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">“Named-entity
recognition” (NER)</a> (this technique would probably also help the
model to understand that to speak of George Hardt as a “Snow Bird” is to
speak of him metaphorically) that would extract out Honoria’s age (we
are, in fact, explicitly told when we meet her for the first time that
she is nine-years old). Furthermore, one could let the model know that
she would thus be quite unlikely to have been married, thus allowing it
to potentially read her “Single” response to Charlie’s question as not
at all literally possible. Of course, it’s easy to speculate on all
kinds of other “metadata”-esque ways one could try to improve the
model’s learning and predictions.</p>
<p>Now, I think that what is really fascinating to me about this line of
thinking and investigation is that these machine algorithms are already
fascinatingly sophisticated and often really, really accurate in what
they can do. And it seems to be the case that the more data (just
straight-up “data,” more “metadata,” whatever) you feed the models, the
better and better they get. Just feed it more data and the results seem
to get better and better.</p>
<h2 id="future-research-interests-and-scholarship-plans">2.3 Future
Research Interests and Scholarship Plans</h2>
<p>I know it is quite customary in works like this to think a little
about future scholarship plans. I would like to try my hand at that
now.</p>
<p>I would guess that it is pretty clear already that my scholarship
record has been rather eclectic.  I have written and published on
Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze (this is true now after the
publication of the essay with MaKenzie), and many other philosophers,
composed book reviews about Tolstoy and Wittgenstein and on recent
contemporary works of poetry, engaged in a brief foray or two into the
realm of ecocritical thought and environmental philosophy, and much
more.  However, since learning how to code and familiarizing myself with
as much as I could about all the standard machine learning libraries
within the Python programming ecosystem, Natural Language Processing
(NLP), data analysis and data science, and many other realms within the
world of computer science, I am anxious to work towards bringing some of
these different areas of study into something a bit more cohesive. </p>
<p>As previously noted, I have already published an article focusing on
advances in AI as they have been worked through in contemporary science
fiction and I am anxious to continue the work already done by Lydia Liu
(<em>The Freudian
Robot</em><label for="sn-101" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-101" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="101" class="sidenote">Lydia Liu, <em>The Freudian Robot: Digital
Media and the Future of the Unconscious</em> (Chicago: U of Chicago P,

id="102" class="sidenote">Isabel Millar, <em>The Psychoanalysis of
Artificial Intelligence</em> (London: Palgrave Macmillan,
2022).</span>).  I would like to bring to bear the work already done
here with all that I have learned about programming and machine learning
more generally.  I think we all know that the boundaries of this
still-emerging field of AI is going to ask those of us working in the
humanities to familiarize ourselves with this arena more and more as the
years go by (no doubt all the hullabaloo about <a
href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI’s

platform has just ratcheted this up exponentially as of late).  As most
readers of psychoanalysis know, Lacan’s own work was heavily influenced
by the early developments in cybernetic theory and thought in the
1950s.  Indeed, Lacan’s conceptualizations of language and the Symbolic
order owe a great deal to the work of Norbert Wiener and many of the
other early pioneers of computational theory broadly construed.  The
next stage of my publishing career will hopefully see me dealing much
more extensively with connections between this psychoanalytic vein (and
the tradition of 20th and 21st Century philosophy in general) and the
advancements in machine learning that the field of computer science has
produced in such large quantities over the past twenty years or so.  I
think that a great deal of work within the confluence of the Lacanian
tradition and “mechanical/machinic intelligence” is still waiting to be
done—especially with regards to the way in which our computer algorithms
can help us to better understand our own subjectivity as human beings. 
As I say, this is an incredibly fruitful and exciting arena for those of
us in the humanities who have learned how to code. </p>
<p>As a tiny little offshoot of these plans, I have also been really
taken, recently, by some of the ways in which we those of us working in
the humanities can leverage some of the machine learning models to
understand the area of law.  Numerous recent <a
href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/">blog posts</a> of mine have
worked with the Supreme Court Database system (SCDB) to do everything
from visualizations of Topic Modeling of the main opinions to the
creation of classification algorithms to learn to predict, say, the
century an opinion was drafted in.  I look forward to continuing to find
more and ever new ways to utilize all of this new computer programming
knowledge to help me investigate the realms of humanistic study that I
used to do without the help of Python.  This whole area of computational
study has opened up all kinds of new avenues for my thinking and my
teaching and I am very excited to see where all the learning about
programming will ultimately take me—I hope it will constantly take me
back to my home base within the humanities where I can know that base,
as T. S. Eliot says, “for the first time” and perhaps in an absolutely
brand new way. Most simply put, I am expecting to continue working
within all the diverse fields that I have worked in since graduate
school, while hopefully finding new ways to tackle these areas with all
the computational knowledge I have recently obtained (and will continue
to obtain every day).</p>
<h1 id="service">3. Service</h1>
<h2 id="service-to-the-department-and-to-the-university">3.1 Service to
the Department and to the University</h2>
<p>For four years, starting immediately after attaining tenure, I
chaired the Department of English and Foreign Languages. This did
involve quite a change in things for me. My time on the tenure clock was
brilliantly constructed by my predecessor, Dr. Kathryn Duys, in such a
way that gave me a great deal of time to devote to the crafting and
polishing of the art of my teaching. However, this obviously changed
over the years as I took over the administrative duties of the English
Department Chair position. Again, looking back on it, I think that this
was quite a transition for someone who originally felt he would live in
the classroom if he could; the switch, however, was perhaps somewhat
smooth as time went on (admittedly much smoother than it was during my
very first year as chair).</p>
<p>Much of my time since being promoted to Associate Professor (and
while I was chair) was taken up with the construction of a number of
different initiatives, improvements to our program, and also a slew of
brand-new things as well at both the departmental and university levels.
A couple of years ago I helped design and implement a brand new
First-Year Experience sequence for all of our students; long before that
I was coordinator for the older “Core” program; I put in a great deal of
time with one of my colleagues (Dr. Duys yet again) getting a “Writing”
concentration added to the English Major (a concentration that we have
seen a really good number of students pursue and graduate with on their
diplomas/transcripts), while also opening up space for interdisciplinary
connections between a number of different disciplines in the Humanities.
As I mentioned closer to the start of this reflection, over the past
couple of years or so Dr. Ioanes and Dean McDermott and I created an
eighteen-hour course sequence in Rhetoric and Composition that is now
offered to high school teachers with MA degrees interested in teaching
dual-credit composition courses in high school. (Illinois Board of
Higher Education guidelines require teachers to have either an MA degree
in English or an MA in a different field along with eighteen credit
hours in the discipline in order to qualify for dual-credit teaching.)
In addition to this there is the brand new “Digital Humanities”
undergraduate major I’ve spoken of already.</p>
<p>During my time as Chair, we also saw nice upticks in majors—along
with our securing two grants totaling close to $100,000 to help fund a
Writing Program Administrator position (I should probably mention that
this hasn’t yet come to fruition) and also to aid with a couple
publishing endeavors connected to USF’s centennial
year.<label for="sn-160" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-160" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="160" class="sidenote">The grant document for the Arthur Vining-Davis

and the work for the CIC NetVUE “Reframing USF” grant can be accessed <a
href="3_service_artifacts/CICNetVUE_Reframing_USF.pdf">here</a>.</span>
Last but by no means least, a dear friend and departmental colleague
member (Dean McDermott) was nominated for and won the “Excellence in
Teaching Award” a couple of Aprils ago—an honor that is quite
significant, given how much focus our university puts on being an
absolutely stellar teacher. This last accomplishment is, by far, my,
our, her greatest one—fertile and nurturing soil helps brilliant
teachers grow and I was (and still am!) incredibly proud of Dean
McDermott for winning this award, which is an enormous honor and one
that the three full-time faculty members in my department deserve a good
deal of credit for. They say it takes a village to raise a child—the
same can so often be said of good departments caring for the growth of
teachers: stellar teachers are a departmental/group effort, every single
step of the way.</p>
<p>I was—this probably goes without saying but I’ll say it
anyways—serving as Chair when Dean McDermott went up (and was granted)
tenure, an extremely significant, monumental achievement. It was, of
course, completely, totally, and duly deserved. She more than earned it.
I do not really at all want to take any credit for Dean McDermott’s
successful tenure bid, but only to say that it’s not really debatable
that such bids may speak to my own success as a
supporter/mentor/guide/etc. of junior faculty. Speaking of this staunch
and unceasing support of junior faculty members, Dr. Ioanes will be
submitting her own tenure portfolio next year and I look forward (one
more time) to helping out with that and supporting her application in
any and every way I can; she is a fantastic teacher, brilliant scholar,
and wonderful colleague and I anticipate and hope that the process goes
swimmingly for her. As I say, any support and help I can provide on that
front will be so willingly given it’s not even funny.</p>
<p>As a final note for this “Service” section, I would just like to
record the fact that In August of last year, I stepped down as chair and
Dr. Ioanes took over running the department. This was without a doubt
the best decision for me, as it gave me more time to work with MaKenzie
and William and get both of them graduated and on to the next set of
challenges and adventures in their lives. All decisions come with
advantages and disadvantages, pros and cons. This decision was full of
nothing but pros, nothing but advantages. I will never, ever, never
second-guess it.</p>

Looking Back at the Future Plans Set Forth in My Portfolio <br /> for Tenure
(2018) and Progress on Said Goals</h1>
<p>I should be brutally honest and confess here that my Tenure Portfolio
is a document that I do not think I have ever looked at since being
granted tenure. I have no doubt this is a terrifying thing to admit, but
it’s the truth. I would venture to guess that I can’t be the only for
whom this is true—a tenure portfolio (if it is successful) might quite
ideally be something we create and then get to say, “Goodness, I’m glad
I don’t have to look at thing for one more second.” Is this the best to
do things? Probably not—but I’d be shocked if all of us who have been
through the tenure process would deny that we have at least thought
something eerily similar to what I confess here. That said, I have no
doubt that one of the things that the “Post-Tenure” review process might
encourage (though I notice that this is not elucidated or enumerated
anywhere in the <em>Policy Manual</em>) is our taking out that old
thing, dusting it off a bit, taking a gander at it and then saying:
“Sheesh, things definitely didn’t turn out the way I anticipated they
would …” As I say, there are good and bad ways to spin this—and thus
with my glaring confession out of the way, I would like to dust this
thing off and see if there’s anything in it that has stood the test of
time.</p>
<p>I do think that there is a way to parse the “future plans” I
speculated on there as doing some work. In the closing section of that
document (§4: FUTURE PROFESSIONAL ORIENTATION), I noted that I thought
option c.) was the one for me: “(c) scholarship shall weigh more than
service.” I wrote there that “[w]hat needs the most work—solely in terms
of myself—is my scholarly
endeavors.”<label for="sn-166" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-166" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="166" class="sidenote">One could very easily note here a fundamental
Lacanian insight about the relationship between “knowledge” and what one
might call “enjoyment” (Lacan’s word is <em>jouissance</em>). As Lacan
lays this out vis-à-vis Aristotle, it is only when there is some kind of
failure in our <em>jouissance</em> that we then seek out and fashion
knowledge (see pp. 54-55 of Lacan’s <em>Seminar XX</em>). As Bruce Fink
glosses this key intuition: “In his discussion of Aristotle, Lacan says
that knowledge finds its motor force in a deficiency of jouissance … We
find the pleasures available to us in life inadequate, and it is owing
to that inadequacy that we expound systems of knowledge—perhaps, first
and foremost, to explain why our pleasure is inadequate and then to
propose how to change things so that it will not be” (<em>Lacan to the
Letter: Reading</em> Écrits <em>Closely</em> [Minneapolis: U of
Minnesota P, 2004, p. 155]). Furthermore, Fink notes that “[k]nowledge
is not motivated by some overflowing of life, some ‘natural exuberance.’
Monkeys may show signs of such exuberance at various moments, but they
do not create logics, mathematical systems, philosophies, or
psychologies. Articulated knowledge (that is, <em>savoir</em>),
according to Lacan, is motivated by some failure of pleasure, some
insufficiency of pleasure: in a word, dissatisfaction.” Was William’s
own “frustration” (or “dissatisfaction” in Fink’s terminology) not a
textbook example of the way in which his own knowledge (so much
knowledge!) of the philosophical tradition was spawned out of his being
profoundly dissatisfied? (I will have more to say about this matter of
<em>jouissance</em> below, in Section 5.2.)</span> I would like to say
that this goal has been more than met. I do not think that I was quite
aware (at the time) that Dr. Duys meant for me to take over the Chair
position almost immediately upon receiving tenure. Had I known that, I
might perhaps said in the portfolio that I envisioned spending a great
deal of time devoting myself to Service (which, of course, was exactly
what happened as I ran the Department for four years after 2018). I
suppose it’s nice to know that despite the bulk of my time switching
over to Service endeavors, I managed to nurture and grow my scholarship
at the same exact time. If you had asked me at the time if I could
envision such a thing like that working out in the way it did, I
probably would have replied, “Absolutely not.” And yet, it did work out
that way. As I say, this is a nice little surprise.</p>
<p>I notice also in that final concluding section a number of endeavors
that have not really panned out. I talk there about aspirations of
developing an “Institute for the Humanities right here at USF”; I
discuss continuing to help with the “Pathways” program and Gen Ed
revision more broadly; I also see that it would be wonderful to have a
fully-fledged Philosophy major to offer to students; there is,
additionally, a discussion of the possibility of creating an MA degree
in English. None of this has really come to fruition, sad to say. Is it
all bad to say such a thing—i.e. that none of the plans mentioned in the
final section of my portfolio have worked out? No, not at all—and the
fact, already noted, that I managed to beef-up my publication record is
not to be given short-shrift. We all know—I think—how difficult it is
for us here at USF to focus on our scholarly production (that’s not to
say anything that everybody doesn’t already know)—the fact that I was
able to pull such a thing off while running a wonderful English
Department is not to be brushed off too easily either.</p>
<p>We all know plans are just that—plans. Still, looking back on this
document, I am pleasantly surprised with how some of my work since
receiving tenure can be made consistent (trying mightily to avoid the
good ol’ <em>ergo hoc, propter hoc</em> fallacy) with some of the ways I
thought things might have gone.</p>
<h1 id="concluding-remarks">5. Concluding Remarks</h1>
<h2 id="future-teaching-plans">5.1 Future Teaching Plans</h2>
<p>I would not be completely and honest if I didn’t say that MaKenzie
and William’s graduation hasn’t left a profound hole in my work. It is
true, they’re not really “gone” in any way, and yet, their moving out of
the university still presents a noticeable and palpable kind of absence.
Despite the fact that both of them have said—and the frequency of this
kind of conversation only increased in the late parts of November as
their graduation day crept ever closer and closer—that despite the fact
that our “situation” would surely be changing once they graduated, our
relations and relationships wouldn’t change in the slightest, I am
feeling quite drastically what a change MaKenzie’s not being able to
come by three days each week every week has made. In those November and
December months, I was trying to prepare myself properly: I knew that I
was going to miss her terribly, but I didn’t know exactly at the time
how much I would miss her. This is all par for the course, obviously,
for teachers: students need to go away from us, go on to new things—but
that doesn’t lessen how much we wish they were still here even after
they do transition to new situations in life.</p>
<p>The <em>USF Policy Manual</em> section on “Post-Tenure Review” notes
that the reflection should contain: “A description of professional goals
and plans for continued professional development in the areas of
teaching, scholarship, and service for the ensuing five years.” To be
perfectly candid here, this third requirement is incredibly difficult
for me. Where exactly do I go from here, now that my two most favorite
students have come and gone (at least in an “official” sense)? Frankly,
I haven’t the slightest idea how to answer this question. What next
steps, indeed, should one take after two of the best years that they’ve
ever had as a teacher in their near-twenty year career, studying,
working, reading, thinking, talking, and writing with the greatest pair
of students they will ever have? As I say, such queries are
frighteningly difficult to handle.</p>
<p>Despite a lack of knowledge here, there are some things that I do, in
fact, know. I know that I am greatly looking forward to continuing to
read, think, and write with MaKenzie. We have already moved forward on a
second project together focusing on the short novella by Carson
McCullers, <em>The Ballad of the Sad
Café</em>.<label for="sn-157" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-157" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="157" class="sidenote">This work can be found in <em>Carson
McCullers: Complete Novels</em>, ed. Carlos L. Dews (New York: The
Library of America, 2001), pp. 397-458.</span> We read this piece for
her “Gender and Sexuality” course—on MaKenzie’s own prompting—and she
fell immediately in love with it; she was understandably fascinated and
intrigued profoundly by McCullers’ treatment of gender there. It was
incredibly generative for her. Recently—as the final edits for the
Millet paper are getting wrapped up—I joked with her, saying, “Okay,
buddy, I kinda got to pick the first project we did together—now it’s
your turn. What should we work on next?” She was rather adamant that the
McCullers project should be next. She has already dove straight into the
deep end again, rampaging through the secondary literature on McCullers
and on “women in Southern fiction” more
generally.<label for="sn-158" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-158" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="158" class="sidenote">I should thank Dr. Ioanes here as she
recommended a critical work by a friend of hers that has already sparked
all kinds of connections for MaKenzie, Monica Carolyn Miller’s <em>Being

through this research with her and whether or not she can get Miller’s
focus on “ugliness” to do some work when applied to <em>Ballad</em>,

book.<label for="sn-159" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-159" class="margin-toggle"/><span

here—we’ll see!</span> Once she gets going on something, it’s hard to
stop her (though why one would even want to bother trying to do such a
thing is itself a legitimate question here). Of course, I know there
were at least five or six other project ideas that she and I batted back
and forth towards the end of the Fall semester: I am still dying to have
a go at Atwood’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, as I’ve mentioned
already. I can easily imagine that one being our next target after the
McCullers.</p>
<p>I also greatly look forward to helping William continue his reading
and training in philosophy—all in preparation for (we hope) his starting
graduate school this upcoming Fall semester. With him too we have a
large number of projects and things we’d like to read and talk about
together. I think I should perhaps be a little bit more adamant that he
take a shot at writing about Hemingway. He and I developed some really
fantastic readings of some of his short fiction—and he’s already pulled
countless articles and secondary sources, none of which quite giving him
exactly what he is looking for in a really stellar reading of Hemingway.
Now, I know that we are currently working through (already mentioned)
Dickens’ <em>Bleak House</em> and <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> (William is
reading them simultaneously) and he has been enjoying these novels in a
way that I am not quite sure I’ve ever seen him enjoy anything else
before. It’s a beautiful and wonderful thing to see and say, that’s for
sure. As of late, William seems to be taking up some of the qualities
that I used to associate pretty much only with MaKenzie: working and
thinking about multiple things all at once. The paper that William wrote
for his Shakespeare course was also really good—I am hopeful to see how
great of a foundation that essay will ultimately serve for his continued
thinking (I’ve already pulled some possible journals that could be
fantastic venues for this essay and I can’t wait to continue to working
on that project with him).</p>
<h2 id="future-scholarship-plans">5.2 Future Scholarship Plans</h2>
<p>I am also quite excited to continue my forays into the “Digital
Humanities” field. I am not quite sure exactly what these future forays
will ultimately look like, but the field seems to me so massive that
there are all kinds of unexplored nooks and crannies that will no doubt
be incredibly fruitful and generative for me. Questions of literary
style, queries about literary language, and even the broader
philosophical concerns that the field of AI will continue pose and
provoke strike me as endlessly engaging. As I mentioned earlier in
[Section
2.3](below](#23-future-research-interests-and-scholarship-plans), it
seems to me that psychoanalysis—especially the Lacanian stripe—is quite
ideally situated and positioned to talk quite convincingly about AI’s
potential “threats” or “destabilization” of something like “the human
being.” It is a basic Lacanian dictum that the human being—as an “animal
that speaks”—is cut, split, carved-up b signifiers (by words). We are
all (well, perhaps not “all,” but certainly the vast majority of us)
born into a highly systematic structure (i.e. language)—the words I use
to name myself and others and everything else in the universe
pre-existed me, I did not create or fashion them. And this system has
rules—rules one must follow—that we never consciously (for sure) ever
agreed to in any way that would resemble something like a nice, simple
“contract” of some kind. Not even that, but my language and my words are
also things I don’t necessary have any control over—the consequences and
results of my speaking can be radically contingent and can produce
effects and affects that I myself do not intend. We are thus all
possessed by something in us that greatly escapes us.</p>
<p>Is any of this something that the machine or artificial intelligence
can approximate somehow? This to me is a wonderfully deep philosophical
question. I think that a lot of the learning I have gained within the
machine learning arena focused on NLP and on the use of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models">“large
language models”</a> and vectorization methods in general to help
translate natural language into something a machine can “understand,”
has shown me more times than I can count that the way we think about
language may edge far closer toward the “machinic” than the purely human
(whatever that might mean at the end of the day). I tried to show in an
earlier section that really quite simple “probabilistic models” like the
“Naive Bayes” classifier can come to some kind of understanding of a
text’s singular stylistic features. I have no problem granting the
argument that when one listens to another person speak, what they are
doing (again, not consciously) is just performing all kinds of
lightning-quick probability calculations about what word or type of word
might come next in the sentence. This would seem to follow quite nicely
from the “systematic” nature of the linguistic systems: when English
speakers here a noun (or pronoun) and then a verb, the parts of speech
that can go in that third slot are not infinite—and even within that
particular slot, all kinds of words that fall under that part of speech
category are possible, but, again, probability would tell us that some
words are more likely to go in that slot than others. Given a system
with some kind of grammar, something like the probabilistic models will
find a great deal of information and data with which to get a handhold
on what’s likely to be going on.</p>
<p>This is perhaps just another way of saying that the true uniqueness
of the human may not be able to to be fully located there at the level
of the “machinic”—or at the level of grammar or at the level of language
as a largely “impersonal” system that places certain words into some
slots and not into others. The large language models seem to be able to
understand this quite well. So, where is something like the uniqueness
of the human (again, just assuming for the moment that such a thing
exists—and this itself does often strike me as quite a debatable
assumption), it can’t be the fact that we all operate with a system that
none of us designed—this would be a facet of our being that is shared
perfectly with the machine. Again, I think that
psychoanalysis—especially in the versions that often get labeled as
broadly <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism">“structuralist”</a>
in nature—can handle this automaticity/mechanicity of language quite
readily and handily. But the thing that, arguably, may not find a place
within the scientific study of language in linguistics is what Lacan
calls “the enunciating subject.” As Bruce Fink puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speech relies on the system of signifiers (or simply on “the
signifier,” as he is wont to say, implying thereby the entire signifying
system of language), borrowing its lexicon and grammar from it, and yet
speech requires something else: enunciation. It has to be enunciated,
and there is a bodily component that is thus introduced: breathing and
all of the movements of the jaw, tongue, and so required for the
production of speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fink goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linguistics concerns itself with the subject of the enunciated or
subject of the statement—for example, “I” in the sentence “I think
so”—which it categorizes as the “shifter.” And it takes into account the
difference between the subject of the statement and the enunciating
subject … Linguistics is forced to take cognizance of the distinction
between these two subjects.<br />
But linguistics does not account for the enunciating subject per se. The
enunciating subject is the one who may take pleasure in speaking, who
may find it painful to speak, or who may make a slip while speaking. The
enunciating subject is the one who may let slip something that is
revealing of his or her feelings, desires, or
pleasures.<label for="sn-161" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-161" class="margin-toggle"/><span

</blockquote>
<p>This is, perhaps, an all-too-long-winded way to say that we are not
just creatures of the signifying system of language, but are also,
simultaneously, creatures of affect, pleasure, suffering, or, to use
Lacan’s term, we are creatures of <em>jouissance</em>, “enjoyment”—we
are creatures of <em>libido</em> in addition to being creatures of
grammar, language, signification, etc. Are our large language models
similar to us in this way? Well, no—or, at least, not yet. Perhaps some
day they will be, but as of today they seem to be able to be a “subject
of the statement” but they are not yet statements of the subject, they
are not “enunciating subjects,” yet. How good of a definition of
something like
“intelligence”<label for="sn-162" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-162" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="162" class="sidenote">Here, of course, we’re thinking quite directly
about the infamous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">“Turing
Test.”</a></span> would it be to say that when a machine can
legitimately fall prey to the “slip of the tongue” phenomenon, then we
will know that the machine has achieved something like “subjectivity”? I
am not sure, but I do quite like this definition, to be honest. As
Isabel Millar, previously mentioned above, has noted in a slightly
different context: when machines start to speak out of some need to
“prove that they are still here,” that they “exist,” then we will need
to rethink everything about them—and
us.<label for="sn-163" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-163" class="margin-toggle"/><span
id="163" class="sidenote">These lines show up in Millar’s reading of
Jean Baudrillard’s <em>The Ecstasy of Communication</em>, where she
writes: “He [Baudrillard] alludes to the need to speak becoming more
urgent when one has nothing to say. In Lacanian terms the jouissance of
the signifier prevails over the constant metonymic slippage of meaning
and becomes the mode of survival for the subject. One speaks to prove
one is still here” (74).</span> I’m not too worried about machines
instantly becoming our mechanical overlords; instead, I just think it’s
a really wonderful time not only to be doing philosophy and
psychoanalysis, but also to be somehow who can do philosophy while
understanding a tiny little bit about the programming infrastructures
upon which these machine models are being built.</p>
<h2 id="future-service-plans">5.3 Future Service Plans</h2>
<p>I am not so certain that I have any real clear or clearly defined
goals in terms of my service work going forward. I would love to find
more time to help grow the Digital Humanities major (DIGH), but it is
not all easy for me to see how to handle this without a great deal of
time and help that I think I (and my other English faculty) probably do
not have in our already busy schedules. I should say that I was
extremely happy to see Dr. McDermott take over the Interim CAS Dean
position that opened up with Dr. Elizabeth Davies’ departure for Chicago
State University. This move was, again, as I say, fantastic, but one of
the real clear ramifications of this was that it did impact an already
rather thinly-stretched English Department quite significantly. One
could easily have argued that our Department was already short-handed
given all that English faculty do already now; this short-handedness is
still with us—and so I am hesitant to say that we should have been doing
much more work on the DIGH front than we have so far. As I’ve already
canvassed here, the English Department has been doing a ton of working
over the past couple of years since the pandemic started in 2020; we
know we are having to juggle a lot more than we did three years ago (the
grad courses for REAL would be just one very legible example of our
increased workload as a Department). I should admit that the addition of
Dr. Veronica Popp as a Visiting Assistant Professor has been incredibly
important for the Department, but, again, we’re still a little
under-resourced and under-staffed.</p>
<p>As of late, Dr. Ioanes and I have had a number of substantial
conversations about the DIGH major—about what it is that we might be
able to do to try growing this major. We have come up with some
potential ways to focus on this, including (this is perhaps top of the
list in terms of our options) the cross-listing of the introductory DIGH
100 course, which is certainly one way we can handle being under-staffed
(this path doesn’t require another faculty member to take this course in
their load, obviously). To my mind, this is far from ideal, but if the
last three years have taught us anything, it is that we faculty are so
frequently being asked to take pragmatic/practical (far from ideal)
solutions to our problems. We will give the cross-listing path a try in
the Fall of 2023 and see what that gets us. Do we need to be reaching
out again to Marketing for more help promoting this major? Again,
probably, but I just cannot quite figure out how to put that on anyone
else’s plate. Is it enough for faculty to simply design new majors, new
curricula, and then just let things run their course? No, probably not,
but one wonders how much institutional buy-in and support there has been
for these new endeavors. I am cognizant how, seemingly, everyone around
USF is stretched-thin, Marketing included; perhaps more communication
focused on promotion would be helpful, but I am not sure if that time
investment will give us results.</p>
<p>If I am able to perfectly candid and honest here, I have been more
than content to kind of just “put my head down” and focus on my
students, my courses, my teaching—and, admittedly—letting my service
commitments take a back seat. Outside of my teaching, my students, and
my classroom, it is far more difficult for me to assess now how
fruitful, useful, and productive the time devoted to Service will
ultimately be in the future. I can very easily see the rewards that a
focus on my teaching has given me and my students over the past three
years (indeed, this reflection on my work with MaKenzie and William
alone should have already made it very clear what these rewards have
been for me—and <em>for them</em>); the rewards of time invested in
Service strikes me as much more murky and hard to cash-out in clear
ways. That said, I will keep cogitating on this, to be sure.</p>
<h1 id="a-final-final-concluding-comment">6 A Final, “Final” Concluding
Comment</h1>
<p>I would just like to bring this to a close here and thank my readers
for taking the time—any bit of time, frankly—for looking through these
materials. I hope I have made an amply cogent argument for the renewal
of my contract here at USF. Once again, all thanks to those of you who
have made it to this point in this reflection—I greatly enjoyed taking a
little bit of time to compose these thoughts, think through these
things, and really get what I think is a really nice handle on how my
time has been spent as an Associate Professor.</p>
